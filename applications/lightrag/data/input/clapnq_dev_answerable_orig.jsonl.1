( July 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) 1980s -- 1990s ( edit ) Johnston 's musical work gained some notability when he moved to Austin , Texas . Johnston began to attract the attention of the local press and gained a following augmented in numbers by his habit of handing out tapes to people he met . Live performances were well - attended and hotly anticipated . His local standing led to him being featured in a 1985 episode of the MTV program The Cutting Edge featuring performers from Austin 's `` New Sincerity '' music scene . Subsequently , he performed at the 1985 Woodshock music festival in Austin and was featured in the short documentary Woodshock . In 1988 , Johnston visited New York City and recorded 1990 with producer Kramer at his Noise New York studio . It was released in 1990 on Kramer 's Shimmy - Disc label . This was Johnston 's first experience in a professional recording environment after a decade of releasing home - made cassette recordings . His mental health further deteriorated during the making of 1990 . In 1989 , Johnston released the album It 's Spooky in collaboration with Half Japanese singer Jad Fair . In 1990 , Johnston played at a music festival in Austin , Texas . On the way back to West Virginia on a private two - seater plane piloted by his father Bill , Johnston had a manic psychotic episode ; believing he was Casper the Friendly Ghost , Johnston removed the key from the plane 's ignition and threw it outside . His father , a former US Air Force pilot , managed to successfully crash - land the plane , even though `` there was nothing down there but trees '' . Although the plane was destroyed , Johnston and his father emerged with only minor injuries . As a result of this episode , Johnston was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital . Interest in Johnston increased when Kurt Cobain was frequently photographed wearing a T - shirt featuring the cover image of Johnston 's album Hi , How Are You that music journalist Everett True gave him . Kurt Cobain listed Yip \/ Jump Music as one of his favorite albums in his journal in 1993 . In spite of Johnston being resident in a mental hospital at the time , there was a bidding war to sign him . He refused to sign a multi-album deal with Elektra Records because Metallica was on the label 's roster and he was convinced that they were of Satan and would hurt him . He also dropped his manager after having a psychotic episode at a Butthole Surfers concert . Ultimately he signed with Atlantic Records in February 1994 and that September released Fun , produced by Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers . It was a commercial failure . In June 1996 , Atlantic dropped Daniel from the label . Johnston 's `` Hi , How Are You '' mural in Austin , Texas . In 1993 , the Sound Exchange record store in Austin , Texas commissioned Johnston to paint a mural of the Hi , How Are You ? frog ( also known as `` Jeremiah the Innocent '' ) from the album 's cover . After the record store closed in 2003 , the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when a Mexican grill franchise called Baja Fresh took ownership and decided to remove the wall that held the mural . A group of people who lived in the neighborhood convinced the managers and contractors to keep the mural intact . As of 2018 , the building houses a Thai restaurant called `` Thai , How Are You '' . Johnston contributed two songs to the soundtrack for Larry Clark 's controversial 1995 film Kids , produced by Folk Implosion and Sebadoh 's frontman , Lou Barlow .

Rocks in 1996 . 2000s ( edit ) In 2004 , he released The Late Great Daniel Johnston : Discovered Covered , a two - disc compilation .

Jeff Feuerzeig 's documentary , four years in the making , collated some of the vast amount of recorded material Johnston ( and in some case , others ) had produced over the years to portray his life and music . The film won high praise , receiving the Director 's Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival .

In 2008 , Dick Johnston , Daniel 's brother and manager , revealed that `` a movie deal based on the artist 's life and music had been finalized with a tentative 2011 release . '' He also said that a deal had been struck with the Converse company for a `` signature series '' Daniel Johnston shoe . Later , it was revealed by Dick Johnston that Converse had dropped the plan . In early 2008 , a Jeremiah the Innocent collectible figurine was released in limited runs of four different colors .

Also that year , Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called Hi , How Are You . The game is similar to Frogger , but features Johnston 's art and music .
