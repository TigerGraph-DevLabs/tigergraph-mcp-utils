( July 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) 1980s -- 1990s ( edit ) Johnston 's musical work gained some notability when he moved to Austin , Texas . Johnston began to attract the attention of the local press and gained a following augmented in numbers by his habit of handing out tapes to people he met . Live performances were well - attended and hotly anticipated . His local standing led to him being featured in a 1985 episode of the MTV program The Cutting Edge featuring performers from Austin 's `` New Sincerity '' music scene . Subsequently , he performed at the 1985 Woodshock music festival in Austin and was featured in the short documentary Woodshock . In 1988 , Johnston visited New York City and recorded 1990 with producer Kramer at his Noise New York studio . It was released in 1990 on Kramer 's Shimmy - Disc label . This was Johnston 's first experience in a professional recording environment after a decade of releasing home - made cassette recordings . His mental health further deteriorated during the making of 1990 . In 1989 , Johnston released the album It 's Spooky in collaboration with Half Japanese singer Jad Fair . In 1990 , Johnston played at a music festival in Austin , Texas . On the way back to West Virginia on a private two - seater plane piloted by his father Bill , Johnston had a manic psychotic episode ; believing he was Casper the Friendly Ghost , Johnston removed the key from the plane 's ignition and threw it outside . His father , a former US Air Force pilot , managed to successfully crash - land the plane , even though `` there was nothing down there but trees '' . Although the plane was destroyed , Johnston and his father emerged with only minor injuries . As a result of this episode , Johnston was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital . Interest in Johnston increased when Kurt Cobain was frequently photographed wearing a T - shirt featuring the cover image of Johnston 's album Hi , How Are You that music journalist Everett True gave him . Kurt Cobain listed Yip \/ Jump Music as one of his favorite albums in his journal in 1993 . In spite of Johnston being resident in a mental hospital at the time , there was a bidding war to sign him . He refused to sign a multi-album deal with Elektra Records because Metallica was on the label 's roster and he was convinced that they were of Satan and would hurt him . He also dropped his manager after having a psychotic episode at a Butthole Surfers concert . Ultimately he signed with Atlantic Records in February 1994 and that September released Fun , produced by Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers . It was a commercial failure . In June 1996 , Atlantic dropped Daniel from the label . Johnston 's `` Hi , How Are You '' mural in Austin , Texas . In 1993 , the Sound Exchange record store in Austin , Texas commissioned Johnston to paint a mural of the Hi , How Are You ? frog ( also known as `` Jeremiah the Innocent '' ) from the album 's cover . After the record store closed in 2003 , the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when a Mexican grill franchise called Baja Fresh took ownership and decided to remove the wall that held the mural . A group of people who lived in the neighborhood convinced the managers and contractors to keep the mural intact . As of 2018 , the building houses a Thai restaurant called `` Thai , How Are You '' . Johnston contributed two songs to the soundtrack for Larry Clark 's controversial 1995 film Kids , produced by Folk Implosion and Sebadoh 's frontman , Lou Barlow . Johnston later covered Schoolhouse Rock ! 's `` Unpack Your Adjectives '' for a compilation of the popular education songs called Schoolhouse Rock ! Rocks in 1996 . 2000s ( edit ) In 2004 , he released The Late Great Daniel Johnston : Discovered Covered , a two - disc compilation . The first disc featured covers of his songs by artists including Tom Waits , Beck , TV on the Radio , Jad Fair , Eels , Bright Eyes , Calvin Johnson , Death Cab for Cutie , Sparklehorse , Mercury Rev , The Flaming Lips and Starlight Mints .

Johnston in 2006 A 2005 Dutch documentary about Johnston for the TV series R.A.M. was followed in 2006 by The Devil and Daniel Johnston . Jeff Feuerzeig 's documentary , four years in the making , collated some of the vast amount of recorded material Johnston ( and in some case , others ) had produced over the years to portray his life and music . The film won high praise , receiving the Director 's Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival . The film also inspired more interest in Johnston 's work , and increased his prestige as a touring artist . In 2006 , Johnston 's label , Eternal Yip Eye Music , released his first greatest - hits compilation , Welcome to My World . He appeared as musical guest on The Henry Rollins Show , performing `` Mask '' and `` Care Less '' ( the latter was exclusive to the Internet ) .

His artwork was shown in galleries such as in London 's Aquarium Gallery , New York 's Clementine Gallery and at the Liverpool Biennial in 2006 and 2008 , and in 2009 , his work was exhibited at `` The Museum of Love '' at Verge Gallery in Sacramento , California . In 2008 , Dick Johnston , Daniel 's brother and manager , revealed that `` a movie deal based on the artist 's life and music had been finalized with a tentative 2011 release . '' He also said that a deal had been struck with the Converse company for a `` signature series '' Daniel Johnston shoe . Later , it was revealed by Dick Johnston that Converse had dropped the plan . In early 2008 , a Jeremiah the Innocent collectible figurine was released in limited runs of four different colors . Later in the year , Adjustable Productions released Johnston 's first concert DVD , The Angel and Daniel Johnston -- Live at the Union Chapel , featuring a 2007 appearance in Islington , London .

Johnston performed a brief solo set before being joined on stage by Cage , who backed performances of several songs , including `` Speeding Motorcycle '' and `` True Love Will Find You in the End '' . Also that year , Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called Hi , How Are You . The game is similar to Frogger , but features Johnston 's art and music .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( December 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The University of Alabama is a school with many traditions . This article describes several of these traditions . Contents ( hide ) 1 Football 1.1 Beginnings of football at Alabama 1.2 The Crimson Tide 1.3 The Elephant 2 The Million Dollar Band 2.1 Naming of the Million Dollar Band 2.2 Directors of the Million Dollar Band 3 School songs 3.1 Alma Mater 3.2 `` Yea Alabama '' 4 Rammer Jammer Cheer 5 References 6 External links Football ( edit ) Beginnings of football at Alabama ( edit ) According to a November 25 , 1926 article in The Crimson White , football was first introduced at the University of Alabama in 1892 by W.G. Little of Livingston , Alabama , who had been a student at Andover , Massachusetts and `` went to the University for the game . '' Alabama 's first football game was played in Birmingham on Friday afternoon , November 11 , 1892 , at the old Lakeview Park . Alabama defeated a team composed mostly of high schoolers 56 - 0 . That Saturday , November 12 , Alabama played the Birmingham Athletic Club , losing 5 - 4 when Ross , of B.A.C. , kicked a 65 - yard field goal . This field goal was a collegiate record at the time . In 1896 the University 's board of trustees passed a rule forbidding athletic teams from traveling off - campus . The following season only one game was played and in 1898 football was abandoned at Alabama . Student opposition to the ruling forced trustees to lift the travel ban and football was resumed in 1899 . The 1918 season was cancelled on account of World War I but the game was resumed the following year . Alabama first gained national recognition for football in 1922 when it defeated the University of Pennsylvania 9 - 7 in Philadelphia . The following season Wallace Wade became head coach and in 1925 led the Crimson Tide to its first undefeated and untied season and its first trip to Pasadena , California with a Rose Bowl invitation . On January 1 , 1926 in the Rose Bowl , Alabama came from behind to upset the University of Washington 20 - 19 . The Crimson Tide ( edit ) Early newspaper accounts of the University 's football squad simply referred to them as the `` varsity '' or the `` Crimson White '' . The first nickname popular with the media was the `` Thin Red Line '' , which was used until 1906 . Hugh Roberts , former sports editor of the Birmingham Age - Herald , is credited with coining the phrase `` Crimson Tide '' in an article describing the 1907 Iron Bowl played in Birmingham with Auburn a heavy favorite to win . The game was played in a sea of red mud which stained the Alabama white jerseys crimson . The elephant ( edit ) There are two stories , perhaps both true , about how Alabama 's football squad became associated with the elephant , both dating to the coaching tenure of Wallace Wade ( 1923 -- 1930 ) . The earliest account attributes the Rosenberger 's Birmingham Trunk Company for the elephant association . Owner J.D. Rosenberger , whose son was a student at the University , outfitted the undefeated 1926 team with `` good luck '' luggage tags for the trip to the 1927 Rose Bowl . The company 's trademark , displayed on the tags , was a red elephant standing on a trunk . When the football team arrived in Pasadena , the reporters greeting them , including syndicated columnist Grantland Rice , associated their large size with the elephants on their luggage . When the 1930 team returned to the Rose Bowl , the company furnished leather suitcases , paid for by the Alumni Association , to each team member . Another story dates to 1930 . Following the October 4 game against Ole Miss , Atlanta Journal sports writer and Hall of Fame former Georgia Tech back Everett Strupper wrote : `` At the end of the quarter , the earth started to tremble , there was a distant rumble that continued to grow . Some excited fan in the stands bellowed , ' Hold your horses , the elephants are coming , ' and out stamped this Alabama varsity . It was the first time that I had seen it and the size of the entire eleven nearly knocked me cold , men that I had seen play last year looking like they had nearly doubled in size . '' Yet , despite the unofficial status as the Crimson Tide 's mascot , the elephant was very much part of the school 's football traditions by the 1940s . It was in that decade that a live elephant mascot named `` Alamite '' was a regular sight on game days in Tuscaloosa . For several years it was traditional for the pachyderm to lead the homecoming parade and Alamite would also bear that year 's queen onto the field prior to the game . Sports writers continued to refer to Alabama as the `` Red Elephants '' afterward , referring to their crimson jerseys . The 1930 team shut out eight of ten opponents , allowing a total of only 13 points all season . The `` Red Elephants '' rolled up 217 points that season , including a 24 - 0 victory over Washington State in the Rose Bowl . Despite these early associations of the elephant to the University of Alabama , the university did not officially accept the elephant as university mascot until 1979 . Alabama 's elephant mascot is known as `` Big Al '' . The Million Dollar Band ( edit ) Main article : Million Dollar Band ( marching band ) The Million Dollar Band performing at a football game The Million Dollar Band , the University of Alabama 's marching band , was founded in 1913 with 14 members under the direction of Dr. Gustav Wittig . In 1917 , the band became a military band and was led by students until 1927 . The Million Dollar Band is the largest performing organization on campus , with around 400 members . The September 1992 issue of Southern Living selected the Million Dollar Band as one of the top ten most outstanding bands in the South . In 2003 it became the twenty - second band to be honored with the Sudler Trophy , given by the Sousa Foundation to recognize `` collegiate marching bands of particular excellence that have made outstanding contributions to the American way of life . '' Additionally , the Million Dollar Band has been nationally televised more than any other college marching band in the country . Naming of the Million Dollar Band ( edit ) There are two stories to the naming of the Million Dollar Band . The main one is from a time when Alabama 's football was n't doing so well . They were playing Georgia Tech and the coach of Georgia Tech stated , `` Your football team is n't worth a nickel , but you have a million dollar band . '' And so the name stuck . In the second story , W.C. `` Champ '' Pickens bestowed the name `` Million Dollar Band '' after the 1922 football game against Georgia Tech . Though accounts vary , it is reported that in order for the band to attend the game they had to solicit funds from local businesses . They were able to collect enough funds to ride in a tourist sleeper to the game . After the game , which Alabama lost 33 - 7 , an Atlanta sportswriter commented to Pickens , `` You do n't have much of a team ; what do you have at Alabama ? '' Pickens replied , `` A Million Dollar Band . '' Directors of the Million Dollar Band ( edit ) 1913 -- 1917 : Gustav Wittig 1917 -- 1927 : Student - led 1927 -- 1934 : Captain H.H. Turner 1935 -- 1968 : Colonel Carleton K. Butler 1969 -- 1970 : Earl Dunn 1971 -- 1983 : James Ferguson 1984 -- 2002 : Kathryn B. Scott 2003 -- present : Kenneth Ozzello School songs ( edit ) Alma mater ( edit ) Like many college alma mater songs written around the turn of the 20th century , the Alabama Alma Mater is set to the tune of `` Annie Lisle '' , a ballad written in the 1850s . The words are usually credited as , `` Helen Vickers , 1908 '' , although it is not clear whether that was when it was written or if that was her graduating class . `` Yea Alabama '' ( edit ) Following Alabama 's 1926 Rose Bowl victory over Washington , a contest was held by The Rammer - Jammer , a student newspaper , for the composition of a fight song . Several entries were submitted to a panel overseen by the Music Department , and the winning entry , `` Yea Alabama '' , was adopted . The composer , Ethelred Lundy ( Epp ) Sykes , a student in the School of Engineering , was the editor of The Rammer - Jammer , and played piano in a jazz ensemble , The Capstone Five . He won the University 's Pan-Hellenic Cup in 1926 for overall achievement , both academically , athletically , and in student affairs . The song achieved considerable popularity during the 20s and 30s . Sykes went on to become a Brigadier General in the U.S Air Force , and donated the copyright and future royalties to the University in 1947 . The Million Dollar Band plays only the chorus at football games such as after touchdowns and field goals . A Dixieland jazz version of the song appeared on the 1950 Percy Faith album Football Songs ( later re-released as Touchdown ! ) and was played extensively across the state in the 1960s and 1970s as the music bed of radio commercials for sporting goods stores . It was also used as the theme music for The Bear Bryant Show . The last words of the song , `` Roll Tide ! '' , have become the standard cheer , greeting , and farewell among Alabama fans . The fight song , as played today , has been shortened to begin with the words `` Yea Alabama '' ; however , the original version had a verse that went at the beginning . The original version did not have `` Roll Tide , Roll Tide ! '' at the end , but was added as a chant immediately following the last line of the song . Amusingly , the song refers to several `` traditional '' opponents , but two of them are no longer part of Alabama 's opponent roster . Georgia Tech ( `` Yellow Jackets '' ) left the SEC in the early 1960s , and has only infrequently filled one of the non-conference game slots , and The University of the South Tigers ( also called Sewanee ) withdrew from the SEC in 1940 , de-emphasized athletics , and no longer competes at the Division I level . Georgia ( `` Bulldogs '' ) , like Alabama , is a member of the SEC , but the Crimson Tide and Bulldogs are in different divisions and play each other only once every six years , unless the schools meet in the SEC Championship Game . Rammer Jammer cheer ( edit ) The `` Rammer Jammer Cheer '' is a traditional cheer . The lyrics originate from The Rammer - Jammer , a student magazine in the 1920s , and the yellowhammer , Alabama 's state bird . The term `` yellowhammer '' was originally used to describe Confederate soldiers from Alabama who wore bright yellow cloth on their uniforms ; when the soldiers marched into the city of Hopkinsville , Kentucky , supporters of the Confederacy cheered them with the chant `` yellowhammer , yellowhammer . '' During and after the American Civil War , the term continued to be used and Alabama became known as the `` Yellowhammer State . '' The cadence of the cheer was adapted from the Ole Miss cheer `` Hotty Toddy '' after then Ole Miss marching band director Dr. James Ferguson was appointed director of the Million Dollar Band . The cheer was long referred to as `` Ole Miss '' , and today the drum major 's signal is still the motioning of one arm in a full circle ( an ' O ' ) . The cheer was a pregame ritual until the early 2000s , chanting `` We 're gon na ' beat the hell out of you ! '' , but this was considered unsportsmanlike and banned . The university also briefly forbade the Million Dollar Band from playing it after games , because of its taunting nature . The move was met with a significant amount of criticism . In a vote at Homecoming 2005 , the question was posed to students of whether the cheer should be banned . 98 % of students voted in favor of keeping the cheer . Before the university 's attempt to remove the cheer , it was played before kickoff and at the end of the game . The cheer is now only played in the closing minutes when victory is certain , and is traditionally chanted twice . On at least one occasion ( during Alabama 's victory over Auburn in the 2008 Iron Bowl , Alabama 's first in the series since 2001 ) , it was repeated an additional four times to signify the breaking of the 6 - game losing streak to Auburn . After Alabama 's victory over the Florida Gators in the 2009 SEC Championship Game , as well as after Alabama 's victory over the Texas Longhorns in the 2010 Citi BCS National Championship Game , the cheer was played nine times . Depending on what team Alabama is playing , the Million Dollar Band and fans will call out to the opposing team by chanting the team 's mascot with the exception being Auburn University ; they do not refer to them as the Tigers , just as Auburn . In other instances , the nickname of the opposing team is substituted ; for instance , a victory over the University of Tennessee would change the opening lyrics to `` Hey Vols ! '' ( short for Volunteers , the nickname \/ mascot for the University of Tennessee ) Also , when the cheer was played before kickoff , fans would replace the lyrics `` We just '' with `` We 're gon na . '' The cheer is no longer played before kickoff ; however , there are a few special occasions where the cheer is played before a football game . One such instance occurs when Alabama plays Tennessee in Knoxville . The night before the football game , the Alabama Alumni Association hosts a riverboat cruise in which Alabama alumni from all around reunite for a night . During the two trips the riverboat cruise takes over the course of the night , the Million Dollar Band members that are a part of the cruises ' pep band will play the Rammer Jammer cheer in the direction of other boats on the river flying a Volunteers ' flag . Author Warren St. John titled his 2004 bestseller about obsessive sports fans Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer after the cheer . The cheer was most noted during the years of Coach Paul `` Bear '' Bryant and his head cheerleader Mickey Grigsby .

{"document_plaintext":"Making out - wikipedia Making out Jump to : navigation , search `` Snog '' redirects here . For the Australian band , see Snog ( band ) . `` Petting '' redirects here . For stroking an animal , see Social grooming . For other uses of `` making out '' , see Make out ( disambiguation ) . A silhouette of a couple making out Making out is a term of American origin , dating back to at least 1949 , and is used variously to refer to kissing , petting , and necking , but may also refer to non-penetrative sex acts such as heavy petting . Snogging has roughly the same meaning in British English and some related varieties of English , except in Hiberno - English ( spoken in Ireland ) , where it is more commonly known as shifting . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Characteristics 3 See also 4 References History ( edit ) The sexual connotations of the phrase `` make out '' appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase 's other meanings of `` to succeed '' . Originally , it meant `` to seduce '' or `` to have sexual intercourse with '' . Studies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century , premarital sex increased , and with it , petting behavior in the 1920s . The Continental experience at that time is amusingly illustrated by a letter that Sigmund Freud wrote to S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi in 1931 playfully admonishing him to stop kissing his patients , in which Freud warned lest `` a number of independent thinkers in matters of technique will say to themselves : Why stop at a kiss ? Certainly one gets further when one adopts ' pawing ' as well , which , after all , does n't make a baby . And then bolder ones will come along who will go further , to peeping and showing -- and soon we shall have accepted in the technique of analysis the whole repertoire of demi - viergerie and petting parties '' . By the postwar period , necking and petting became accepted behavior in mainstream American culture , as long as the partners were dating , and became the subject of numerous jokes : ' He : `` Darling , I 'm groping for words . '' She : `` You wo n't find them there . '' ( N.Y. 1940 ) ' . Characteristics ( edit ) Making out is usually considered an expression of affection or sexual attraction . An episode of making out is frequently referred to as a `` make - out session '' or simply `` making out , '' depending on the speaker 's vernacular . It covers a wide range of sexual behavior , and means different things to different age groups in different parts of the United States . It typically refers to kissing , including prolonged , passionate , open - mouth kissing ( also known as French kissing ) , and intimate skin - to - skin contact . The term can also refer to other forms of foreplay such as heavy petting , which typically involves some genital stimulation , but usually not the direct act of penetrative sexual intercourse . The perceived significance of making out may be affected by the age and relative sexual experience of the participants . Teenagers sometimes play party games in which making out is the main activity as an act of exploration . Games in this category include seven minutes in heaven and spin the bottle . Teenagers may have had social gatherings in which making out was the predominant event . In the United States , these events were referred to as `` make - out parties '' and would sometimes be confined to a specific area , called the `` make - out room '' . These make - out parties were generally not regarded as sex parties , though heavy petting may have been involved , depending on the group .

Lake Kariba is the world 's largest man - made lake and reservoir by volume . It lies 1300 kilometres upstream from the Indian Ocean , along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe . Lake Kariba was filled between 1958 and 1963 following the completion of the Kariba Dam at its northeastern end , flooding the Kariba Gorge on the Zambezi River . The Zimbabwean town of Kariba was built for construction workers on the lake 's dam , while some other settlements such as Binga village and Mlibizi in Zimbabwe and Siavonga and Sinazongwe in Zambia have grown up to house people displaced by the rising waters . Contents ( hide ) 1 Physical characteristics 2 Ecology 3 Protected areas 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Physical characteristics ( edit ) Lake Kariba is over 223 kilometres ( 139 miles ) long and up to 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) in width . It covers an area of 5,580 square kilometres ( 6.01 \u00d7 10 square feet ) mi ) and its storage capacity is 185 cubic kilometres ( 44 cubic miles ) . The mean depth of the lake is 29 metres ( 95 feet ) ; the maximum depth is 97 metres ( 318 feet ) . It is the world 's largest man - made reservoir , four times as large as the Three Gorges Dam . The enormous mass of water ( approximately 180,000,000,000,000 kilograms , or 180 petagrams ( 200 billion tons ) ) is believed to have caused induced seismicity in the seismically active region , including over 20 earthquakes of greater than 5 magnitude on the Richter scale . The lake has several islands , including Maaze Island , Mashape Island , Chete Island , Sekula , Sampa Karuma , Fothergill , Spurwing , Snake Island , Antelope Island , Bed Island , and Chikanka . Ecology ( edit ) Kariba Dam Before Lake Kariba was filled , the existing vegetation was burned , creating a thick layer of fertile soil on land that would become the lake bed . As a result , the ecology of Lake Kariba is vibrant . A number of fish species have been introduced to the lake , notably the sardine - like kapenta ( transported from Lake Tanganyika ) , which now supports a thriving commercial fishery . Other inhabitants of Lake Kariba include Nile crocodiles and hippopotami . Gamefish , particularly tigerfish , which was among the indigenous species of the Zambezi river system , now thrive on the kapenta , which in turn encourages tourism . Both Zambia and Zimbabwe are now attempting to develop the tourism industry along their respective coasts of Lake Kariba . Fish eagles , cormorants and other water birds patrol the shorelines , as do occasional herds of elephants . Protected areas ( edit ) The portion of Lake Kariba which falls within Zimbabwe has been designated a Recreational Park within the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Estate .

It was the first major battle of the American Civil War . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the rebellion . Yielding to political pressure , Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction . McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage . Confederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad , and the course of the battle quickly changed . A brigade of Virginians under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute , Thomas J. Jackson , stood its ground , which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname , `` Stonewall '' . The Confederates launched a strong counterattack , and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire , many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout . McDowell 's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington , D.C. Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties , and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated . The Battle of First Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war . Units were committed piecemeal , attacks were frontal , infantry failed to protect exposed artillery , tactical intelligence was nil , and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively . McDowell , with 35,000 men , was only able to commit about 18,000 , and the combined Confederate forces , with about 32,000 men , committed only 18,000 .

On April 15 , 1861 , the day after South Carolina military forces attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor , President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring an insurrection against the laws of the United States . Earlier , South Carolina and seven other Southern states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America . To suppress the rebellion and restore Federal law in the Southern states , Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers with ninety - day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000 . He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three - year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to almost 20,000 . Lincoln 's actions caused four more Southern states , including Virginia , to secede and join the Confederacy , and by 1 June the Confederate capital had been moved from Montgomery , Alabama , to Richmond , Virginia . In Washington , D.C. , as thousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital , General in Chief Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott laid out his strategy to subdue the rebellious states . He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized and sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans . While the Army `` strangled '' the Confederacy in the west , the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts . The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott 's `` Anaconda Plan '' . Instead , many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond , only one hundred miles south of Washington , would quickly end the war . By July 1861 thousands of volunteers were camped in and around Washington . Since General Scott was seventy - five years old and physically unable to lead this force , the administration searched for a more suitable field commander . Lt. Gen.

Irvin McDowell ( edit ) Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase championed fellow Ohioan , 42 - year - old Maj . Irvin McDowell . Although McDowell was a West Point graduate , his command experience was limited . In fact , he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General 's Office . While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase , a former Ohio governor and senator . Now , through Chase 's influence , McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command ( by President Abraham Lincoln ) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia , which included the military forces in and around Washington ( Army of Northeastern Virginia ) . McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia , 35,000 men arranged in five divisions . Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations , McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops . Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments , but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level . He was reassured by President Lincoln , `` You are green , it is true , but they are green also ; you are all green alike . '' Against his better judgment , McDowell commenced campaigning . Intelligence ( edit ) During the previous year , U.S. Army captain Thomas Jordan set up a pro-Southern spy network in Washington City , including Rose O'Neal Greenhow , a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts . He provided her with a code for messages . After he left to join the Confederate Army , he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her . On July 9 and 16 , 1861 , Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard containing critical information regarding military movements for what would be the First Battle of Bull Run , including the plans of Union general McDowell . McDowell 's plan and initial movements in the Manassas Campaign ( edit ) On July 16 , 1861 , McDowell departed Washington with the largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent , about 35,000 men ( 28,452 effectives ) . McDowell 's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns , while the third column moved around the Confederates ' right flank to the south , cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening the rear of the Confederate army . He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River , the next defensible line in Virginia , which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital . McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July , but the troops , unaccustomed to marching , moved in starts and stops . Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water , regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks . The Confederate Army of the Potomac ( 21,883 effectives ) under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction , approximately 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the United States capital . McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army . Union Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson 's 18,000 men engaged Johnston 's force ( the Army of the Shenandoah at 8,884 effectives , augmented by Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes 's brigade of 1,465 ) in the Shenandoah Valley , preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard . Movements July 16 -- 21 , 1861 Situation July 18 Battlefield of Manassas After two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat , the Union army was allowed to rest in Centreville . McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon with 5,000 troops to protect the army 's rear . In the meantime , McDowell searched for a way to outflank Beauregard , who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run . On July 18 , the Union commander sent a division under Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler to pass on the Confederate right ( southeast ) flank. Tyler was drawn into a skirmish at Blackburn 's Ford over Bull Run and made no headway . Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard 's assistance if possible . Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon , while Stuart 's cavalry screened the movement from Patterson . Patterson was completely deceived . One hour after Johnston 's departure Patterson telegraphed Washington , `` I have succeeded , in accordance with the wishes of the General - in - Chief , in keeping General Johnston 's force at Winchester . '' For the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly . He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction . If the rumors were true , McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates , instead of 22,000 . Another reason for quick action was McDowell 's concern that the ninety - day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire . `` In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force '' , he wrote Washington on the eve of battle . In fact , the next morning two units of McDowell 's command , their enlistments expiring that day , would turn a deaf ear to McDowell 's appeal to stay a few days longer . Instead , to the sounds of battle , they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service . Becoming more frustrated , McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left ( northwest ) flank instead . He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler 's division at the Stone Bridge on the Warrenton Turnpike and send the divisions of Brig . Gens . David Hunter and Samuel P. Heintzelman over Sudley Springs Ford . From here , these divisions could march into the Confederate rear . The brigade of Col. Israel B. Richardson ( Tyler 's Division ) would harass the enemy at Blackburn 's Ford , preventing them from thwarting the main attack . Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area . Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan , it had a number of flaws : it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks , skills that had not been developed in the nascent army ; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take ; finally , McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston 's Valley force was able to board trains at Piedmont Station and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard 's men . Prelude to battle ( edit ) On July 19 -- 20 , significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run . Johnston arrived with all of his army , except for the troops of Brig. Gen. Kirby Smith , who were still in transit . Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn 's Ford , and Beauregard 's plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville . Johnston , the senior officer , approved the plan . If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously , it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other 's left flank . McDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents , so he called for the balloon Enterprise , which was being demonstrated by Prof. Thaddeus S.C. Lowe in Washington , to perform aerial reconnaissance . Opposing forces ( edit ) Union ( edit ) Further information : Union order of battle Key Union commanders Brig. Gen .

Tyler 's division ( about 8,000 ) marched directly toward the Stone Bridge . The inexperienced units immediately developed logistical problems . Tyler 's division blocked the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike . The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate , little more than a cart path in some places , and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9 : 30 a.m. Tyler 's men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m. At 5 : 15 a.m. , Richardson 's brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell 's Ford on the Confederate right , some of which hit Beauregard 's headquarters in the Wilmer McLean house as he was eating breakfast , alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted . Nevertheless , he ordered demonstration attacks north toward the Union left at Centreville . Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution . Although he intended for Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to lead the attack , Ewell , at Union Mills Ford , was simply ordered to `` hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment 's notice '' . Brig. Gen. D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of Ewell , but found himself moving forward alone . Holmes was also supposed to support , but received no orders at all . U.S. cavalry at Sudley Spring Ford An 1862 illustration of a Confederate officer forcing slaves to fire a cannon at U.S. forces at gunpoint . According to John Parker , a former slave , he was forced by his Confederate captors to fire a cannon at U.S. soldiers at the Battle of Bull Run . All that stood in the path of the 20,000 Union soldiers converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan `` Shanks '' Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men . Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge , but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints . He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander , Beauregard 's signal officer , observing from 8 miles ( 13 km ) southwest on Signal Hill . In the first use of wig - wag semaphore signaling in combat , Alexander sent the message `` Look out for your left , your position is turned . '' Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill , a low rise to the northwest of his previous position . The Confederate delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack launched by Major Roberdeau Wheat 's 1st Louisiana Special Battalion , `` Wheat 's Tigers '' . After Wheat 's command was thrown back , and Wheat seriously wounded , Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and Col. Francis S. Bartow , bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men . They successfully slowed Hunter 's lead brigade ( Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside ) in its attempts to ford Bull Run and advance across Young 's Branch , at the northern end of Henry House Hill . One of Tyler 's brigade commanders , Col. William Tecumseh Sherman , crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders . This surprise attack , coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj . George Sykes , collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11 : 30 a.m. , sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill . ( Further map details , see : Additional Map 4 , Additional Map 5 , Additional Map 6 and Additional Map 7 . ) Noon phase ( edit ) Henry House Hill ( edit ) As they retreated from their Matthews Hill position , the remainder of Evans 's , Bee 's , and Bartow 's commands received some cover from Capt . John D. Imboden and his battery of four 6 - pounder guns , who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill . They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard , who had just arrived from Johnston 's headquarters at the M. Lewis Farm , `` Portici '' . Fortunately for the Confederates , McDowell did not press his advantage and attempt to seize the strategic ground immediately , choosing to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts . James B. Ricketts ( Battery I , 1st U.S. Artillery ) and Charles Griffin ( Battery D , 5th U.S. ) from Dogan 's Ridge . Attacks on Henry House Hill , noon -- 2 p.m Union retreat , after 4 p.m. Brig. Gen Thomas J. Jackson 's Virginia Brigade came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon , accompanied by Col. Wade Hampton and his Hampton 's Legion , and Col. J.E.B. Stuart 's cavalry . The Hampton Legion , some 600 men strong , managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman 's advancing brigade . Hampton had purchased about 400 British Enfield rifles to equip the men with , however it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle . If so , they would have been the only foreign - made weapons on the field . The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton 's musket fire and began to disintegrate . Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel , James Cameron , and remarked `` Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they wo n't follow him . '' Shortly afterwards , Cameron , the brother of US Senator Simon Cameron , was fatally wounded . It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day , although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York . Jackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill , where they were shielded from direct fire , and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line , which he posted on the crest of the hill ; as the guns fired , their recoil moved them down the reverse slope , where they could be safely reloaded . Meanwhile , McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan 's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support . Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across 300 yards ( 270 m ) against Jackson 's 13 . Unlike many engagements in the Civil War , here the Confederate artillery had an advantage . The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges , with many shots fired over the head of their targets . Ruins of Judith Henry 's house , `` Spring Hill '' , after the battle Postwar house on site of Judith Henry house in Manassas Judith Henry grave One of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry , an 85 - year - old widow and invalid , who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House . As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire , he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building . A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow 's feet and inflicted multiple injuries , from which she died later that day . `` The Enemy are driving us '' , Bee exclaimed to Jackson . Jackson , a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the Virginia Military Institute , is said to have replied , `` Then , Sir , we will give them the bayonet . '' Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting , `` There is Jackson standing like a stone wall . Let us determine to die here , and we will conquer . Rally behind the Virginians . '' This exclamation was the source for Jackson 's ( and his brigade 's ) nickname , `` Stonewall '' . Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day , thus it is unclear exactly what he meant , moreover none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle . Col. States Rights Gist , serving as Bee 's aide - de-camp , took command of the brigade . Major Burnett Rhett , chief of staff to General Johnston , claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson 's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee 's and Bartow 's brigades while they were under heavy pressure . Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee 's statement was meant to be pejorative : `` Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall ! '' Artillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line , hoping to provide enfilade fire against the Confederates . At approximately 3 p.m. , these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia , whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms , causing Griffin 's commander , Maj . William F. Barry , to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them . Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia and Stuart 's cavalry attack against the flank of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment ( Ellsworth 's Fire Zouaves ) , which was supporting the battery , killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry . Capitalizing on this success , Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts 's guns and they were captured as well . As additional Federal infantry engaged , the guns changed hands several times . Capture of Ricketts ' Battery , painting by Sidney E. King , National Park Service The capture of the Union guns turned the tide of battle . Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill , outnumbering the Confederates two to one , no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously . Jackson continued to press his attacks , telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry , `` Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards ! Then fire and give them the bayonet ! And when you charge , yell like furies ! '' For the first time , Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell . At about 4 p.m. , the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke 's brigade . To the west , Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. Oliver Otis Howard 's brigade from Heintzelman 's division . Also at 4 p.m. , two Confederate brigades - Col. Jubal Early 's , which had moved from the Confederate right , and Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith 's ( commanded by Col. Arnold Elzey after Smith was wounded ) , which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valley -- crushed Howard 's brigade . Beauregard ordered his entire line forward . At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell 's army was disintegrating . Thousands , in large and small groups or as individuals , began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville . McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers , but most had had enough . Unable to stop the mass exodus , McDowell gave orders for Porter 's regular infantry battalion , near the intersection of the turnpike and Manassas - Sudley Road , to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew . The unit briefly held the crossroads , then retreated eastward with the rest of the army . McDowell 's force crumbled and began to retreat . ( Further map details , see : Additional Map 8 , Additional Map 9 , Additional Map 10 , Additional Map 11 and Additional Map 12 . ) Union retreat ( edit ) The retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings , but it was poorly managed by the Union officers . A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell 's force . As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville , discarding their arms and equipment , McDowell ordered Col. Dixon S. Miles 's division to act as a rear guard , but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington . In the disorder that followed , hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner . Wagons and artillery were abandoned , including the 30 - pounder Parrott rifle , which had opened the battle with such fanfare . Expecting an easy Union victory , the wealthy elite of nearby Washington , including congressmen and their families , had come to picnic and watch the battle . When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder , the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages . Since their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well , Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage , despite urging from Confederate President Jefferson Davis , who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating . An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank , using the brigades of Brig . Gens . Milledge L. Bonham and James Longstreet , was a failure . The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham 's men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard , and found that Richardson 's brigade blocked the road to Centreville , he called off the pursuit . In Washington President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory . Instead , a telegram arrived stating `` General McDowell 's army in full retreat through Centreville . The day is lost . Save Washington and the remnants of this army . '' The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital . From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond , `` We have won a glorious but dear - bought victory . Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued . '' Aftermath ( edit ) Brief observations ( edit ) First Bull Run was a clash between relatively large , ill - trained bodies of recruits , led by inexperienced officers . Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively ; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle , only 18,000 had actually been engaged . Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield , he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades , instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole . Other factors contributed to McDowell 's defeat : Patterson 's failure to hold Johnston in the valley ; McDowell 's two - day delay at Centreville ; allowing Tyler 's division to lead the march on 21 July thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman ; and the 2 1 \/ 2 - hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews ' Hill , which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill . On Henry Hill Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level , generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves . Johnston 's decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory . Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time , almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle . After reaching Manassas Junction , Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard , but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive . Jackson and Bee 's brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle ; Jackson 's brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50 % casualties . Detailed casualties ( edit ) Bull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up to that point . Union casualties were 460 killed , 1,124 wounded , and 1,312 missing or captured ; Confederate casualties were 387 killed , 1,582 wounded , and 13 missing . Among the Union dead was Col. James Cameron , brother of President Lincoln 's first Secretary of War , Simon Cameron . Among the Confederate casualties was Col. Francis S. Bartow , who was the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War . General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day . Compared to later battles , casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy . Both Union and Confederate killed , wounded , and missing were a little over one thousand seven hundred each . Two Confederate brigade commanders , Jackson and Edmund Kirby - Smith , were wounded in the battle . No Union officers above the regimental level were killed ; two division commanders ( Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter ) , and one brigade commander ( Orlando Willcox ) were wounded .

We are utterly and disgracefully routed , beaten , whipped by secessionists . -- Union diarist George Templeton Strong If the war had turned out to be of short duration , Bull Run would have been a disaster for the Union . But if , as now seemed more plausible , a long and nasty war was inevitable , that battle had a curiously salutary effect for the Union side . It provided a wake - up call for those optimists -- like Seward or even Lincoln -- who had hoped for or counted on a quick result . -- David Detzer , Donnybrook Bull Run was a turning point in the American Civil War ... in the sense that the battle struck with impelling force upon public opinion at home and abroad , upon Congress , and upon the Commander - in - chief . It framed new patterns of thought and led to far - reaching changes in the conduct of the war . The failure at Bull Run inspired a second Northern rising . Volunteering accelerated , 90 - day men reenlisted , states rushed fresh regiments forward in plenitude ... As they realized victory would not come readily , a new mood fastened upon Northerners . An iron resolve entered the Northern soul ... -- James A. Rawley , Turning Points of the Civil War Effect on the Union and subsequent events ( edit ) Union forces and civilians alike feared that Confederate forces would advance on Washington , D.C. , with very little standing in their way . On July 24 , Prof. Thaddeus S.C. Lowe ascended in the balloon Enterprise to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax . He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces , but was forced to land in Confederate territory . It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters . He reported that his observations `` restored confidence '' to the Union commanders . The Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated . Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined . On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service . On July 25 , eleven thousand Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War , Simon Cameron , for federal service in either Patterson 's or McDowell 's command arrived in Washington , D.C. , and were finally accepted . Three months after First Bull Run Union forces suffered another , smaller defeat at the Battle of Ball 's Bluff , near Leesburg , Virginia . The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball 's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War , a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs . Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run , the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell 's army . Although the committee 's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson 's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard , Patterson 's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle , and he was no longer in the service . The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat , and McDowell bore the chief blame . On 25 July 1861 , he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who would soon be named general - in - chief of all the Union armies . McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia thirteen months later , at the Second Battle of Bull Run . Effect on the Confederacy ( edit ) The reaction in the Confederacy was more muted . There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory , the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well . Once the euphoria of victory had worn off , Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers . Beauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by C.S. President Davis to full general in the Confederate army . Stonewall Jackson , arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory , received no special recognition , but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign . Privately , Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory . Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow : `` Our President and our General direct me to thank you . We rely upon you for further information . The Confederacy owes you a debt . ( Signed ) JORDAN , Adjutant - General . '' The battle also had long - term psychological consequences . The decisive victory led to a degree of over-confidence on the part of Confederate forces , while prompting a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union . In hindsight commentators on both sides agreed that the one - sided outcome `` proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy '' . Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation , James M. McPherson has argued that the esprit de corps attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory , together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders , also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months . Confederate victory : turning point of the American Civil War ( edit ) Further information : Turning point of the American Civil War \u00a7 Confederate victory in First Battle of Bull Run ( July 1861 ) `` Bull Run '' vs. `` Manassas '' ( edit ) The name of the battle has caused controversy since 1861 . The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting ; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms . The U.S. National Park Service uses the Confederate name for its national battlefield park , but the Union name ( Bull Run ) also has widespread currency in popular literature . Confusion between the battle flags ( edit ) Battlefield confusion between the battle flags , especially the similarity of the Confederacy 's `` Stars and Bars '' and the Union 's `` Stars and Stripes '' when fluttering , led to the adoption of the Confederate Battle Flag , which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the South in general . Conclusions ( edit ) First Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle , and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict . The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men . One year later many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run , now combat veterans , would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the Second Battle of Bull Run \/ Manassas .

{"document_plaintext":"Command - line interface - wikipedia Command - line interface Not to be confused with Text - based user interface . Screenshot of a sample bash session in GNOME Terminal 3 , Fedora 15 Screenshot of Windows PowerShell 1.0 , running on Windows Vista A command - line interface or command language interpreter ( CLI ) , also known as command - line user interface , console user interface and character user interface ( CUI ) , is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user ( or client ) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text ( command lines ) . A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or shell ( computing ) . The CLI was the primary means of interaction with most computer systems on computer terminals in the mid-1960s , and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on OpenVMS , Unix systems and personal computer systems including MS - DOS , CP \/ M and Apple DOS . The interface is usually implemented with a command line shell , which is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions . Today , many end users rarely , if ever , use command - line interfaces and instead rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu - driven interactions . However , many software developers , system administrators and advanced users still rely heavily on command - line interfaces to perform tasks more efficiently , configure their machine , or access programs and program features that are not available through a graphical interface . Alternatives to the command line include , but are not limited to text user interface menus ( see IBM AIX SMIT for example ) , keyboard shortcuts , and various other desktop metaphors centered on the pointer ( usually controlled with a mouse ) . Examples of this include the Windows versions 1 , 2 , 3 , 3.1 , and 3.11 ( an OS shell that runs in DOS ) , DosShell , and Mouse Systems PowerPanel . Programs with command - line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting . Command - line interfaces for software other than operating systems include a number of programming languages such as Tcl \/ Tk , PHP , and others , as well as utilities such as the compression utility WinZip , and some FTP and SSH \/ Telnet clients .

Since options to commands are given in a few characters in each command line , an experienced user finds the options easier to access . Automation of repetitive tasks is simplified - most operating systems using a command line interface support some mechanism for storing frequently used sequences in a disk file , for re-use ; this may extend to a scripting language that can take parameters and variable options . A command - line history can be kept , allowing review or repetition of commands . A command - line system may require paper or online manuals for the user 's reference , although often a `` help '' option provides a concise review of the options of a command . The command - line environment may not provide the graphical enhancements such as different fonts or extended edit windows found in a GUI . It may be difficult for a new user to become familiar with all the commands and options available , compared with the drop - down menus of a graphical user interface , without repeated reference to manuals . Operating system command - line interfaces ( edit ) Operating system ( OS ) command line interfaces are usually distinct programs supplied with the operating system . A program that implements such a text interface is often called a command - line interpreter , command processor or shell . Examples of command - line interpreters include DEC 's DIGITAL Command Language ( DCL ) in OpenVMS and RSX - 11 , the various Unix shells ( sh , ksh , csh , tcsh , bash , etc . ) , CP \/ M 's CCP , DOS 's COMMAND.COM , as well as the OS \/ 2 and the Windows CMD. EXE programs , the latter groups being based heavily on DEC 's RSX - 11 and RSTS CLIs . Under most operating systems , it is possible to replace the default shell program with alternatives ; examples include 4DOS for DOS , 4OS2 for OS \/ 2 , and 4NT or Take Command for Windows . Although the term ' shell ' is often used to describe a command - line interpreter , strictly speaking a ' shell ' can be any program that constitutes the user - interface , including fully graphically oriented ones . For example , the default Windows GUI is a shell program named EXPLORER. EXE , as defined in the SHELL = EXPLORER. EXE line in the WIN. INI configuration file . These programs are shells , but not CLIs . Application command - line interfaces ( edit ) Application programs ( as opposed to operating systems ) may also have command line interfaces . An application program may support none , any , or all of these three major types of command line interface mechanisms : Parameters : Most operating systems support a means to pass additional information to a program when it is launched . When a program is launched from an OS command line shell , additional text provided along with the program name is passed to the launched program . Interactive command line sessions : After launch , a program may provide an operator with an independent means to enter commands in the form of text . OS inter-process communication : Most operating systems support means of inter-process communication ( for example ; standard streams or named pipes ) . Command lines from client processes may be redirected to a CLI program by one of these methods . Some applications support only a CLI , presenting a CLI prompt to the user and acting upon command lines as they are entered . Other programs support both a CLI and a GUI . In some cases , a GUI is simply a wrapper around a separate CLI executable file . In other cases , a program may provide a CLI as an optional alternative to its GUI . CLIs and GUIs often support different functionality . For example , all features of MATLAB , a numerical analysis computer program , are available via the CLI , whereas the MATLAB GUI exposes only a subset of features . The early Sierra games , like the first three King 's Quest games ( 1984 -- 1986 ) , used commands from an internal command line to move the character around in the graphic window . History ( edit ) The command - line interface evolved from a form of dialog once conducted by humans over teleprinter ( TTY ) machines , in which human operators remotely exchanged information , usually one line of text at a time . Early computer systems often used teleprinter machines as the means of interaction with a human operator . The computer became one end of the human - to - human teleprinter model . So instead of a human communicating with another human over a teleprinter , a human communicated with a computer . The mechanical teleprinter was replaced by a `` glass tty '' , a keyboard and screen emulating the teleprinter . `` Smart '' terminals permitted additional functions , such as cursor movement over the entire screen , or local editing of data on the terminal for transmission to the computer . As the microcomputer revolution replaced the traditional -- minicomputer + terminals -- time sharing architecture , hardware terminals were replaced by terminal emulators -- PC software that interpreted terminal signals sent through the PC 's serial ports . These were typically used to interface an organization 's new PC 's with their existing mini - or mainframe computers , or to connect PC to PC . Some of these PCs were running Bulletin Board System software . Early operating system CLIs were implemented as part of resident monitor programs , and could not easily be replaced . The first implementation of the shell as a replaceable component was part of the Multics time - sharing operating system . In 1964 , MIT Computation Center staff member Louis Pouzin developed the RUNCOM tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument substitution . Pouzin coined the term `` shell '' to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language , and wrote a paper about how to implement the idea in the Multics operating system . Pouzin returned to his native France in 1965 , and the first Multics shell was developed by Glenda Schroeder . The first Unix shell , the V6 shell , was developed by Ken Thompson in 1971 at Bell Labs and was modeled after Schroeder 's Multics shell . The Bourne shell was introduced in 1977 as a replacement for the V6 shell . Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter , it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs . The Bourne shell led to the development of the Korn shell ( ksh ) , Almquist shell ( ash ) , and the popular Bourne - again shell ( or Bash ) . Early microcomputers themselves were based on a command - line interface such as CP \/ M , DOS or AppleSoft BASIC . During the 1980s and 1990s , the introduction of the Apple Macintosh and of Microsoft Windows on PCs saw the command line interface as the primary user interface replaced by the Graphical User Interface . The command line remained available as an alternative user interface , often used by system administrators and other advanced users for system administration , computer programming and batch processing . In November 2006 , Microsoft released version 1.0 of Windows PowerShell ( formerly codenamed Monad ) , which combined features of traditional Unix shells with their proprietary object - oriented . NET Framework . MinGW and Cygwin are open - source packages for Windows that offer a Unix - like CLI . Microsoft provides MKS Inc. 's ksh implementation MKS Korn shell for Windows through their Services for UNIX add - on . Since 2001 , the Macintosh operating system is based on a variation of Unix called Darwin . On these computers , users can access a Unix - like command - line interface called Terminal found in the Applications Utilities folder . This terminal uses bash by default .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( April 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) A CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries , coupled with a wide ( or arbitrary ) range of options , can be entered more rapidly as text than with a pure GUI . This is typically the case with operating system command shells . CLIs are also used by systems with insufficient resources to support a graphical user interface . Some computer language systems ( such as Python , Forth , LISP , Rexx , and many dialects of BASIC ) provide an interactive command - line mode to allow for rapid evaluation of code . CLIs are often used by programmers and system administrators , in engineering and scientific environments , and by technically advanced personal computer users . CLIs are also popular among people with visual disability , since the commands and responses can be displayed using Refreshable Braille displays . Anatomy of a shell CLI ( edit ) This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( July 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The general pattern of an OS command line interface is : Prompt command param1 param2 param3 ... paramN Prompt - generated by the program to provide context for the client . Command -- provided by the client . Commands are usually one of three classes : Internal -- recognized and processed by the command line interpreter itself and not dependent upon any external executable file . Included -- A separate executable file generally considered part of the operating environment and always included with the OS . External -- External executable files not part of the basic OS , but added by other parties for specific purposes and applications . param1 ... paramN -- Optional parameters provided by the client . The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued . In the case of Included or External commands , the values of the parameters are delivered to the program ( specified by the Command ) as it is launched by the OS . Parameters may be either Arguments or Options . In this example , the delimiters between command line elements are whitespace characters and the end - of - line delimiter is the newline delimiter . This is a widely used ( but not universal ) convention for command - line interfaces . A CLI can generally be considered as consisting of syntax and semantics . The syntax is the grammar that all commands must follow . In the case of operating systems , DOS and Unix each define their own set of rules that all commands must follow . In the case of embedded systems , each vendor , such as Nortel , Juniper Networks or Cisco Systems , defines their own proprietary set of rules that all commands within their CLI conform to . These rules also dictate how a user navigates through the system of commands . The semantics define what sort of operations are possible , on what sort of data these operations can be performed , and how the grammar represents these operations and data -- the symbolic meaning in the syntax . Two different CLIs may agree on either syntax or semantics , but it is only when they agree on both that they can be considered sufficiently similar to allow users to use both CLIs without needing to learn anything , as well as to enable re-use of scripts . A simple CLI will display a prompt , accept a `` command line '' typed by the user terminated by the Enter key , then execute the specified command and provide textual display of results or error messages . Advanced CLIs will validate , interpret and parameter - expand the command line before executing the specified command , and optionally capture or redirect its output . Unlike a button or menu item in a GUI , a command line is typically self - documenting , stating exactly what the user wants done . In addition , command lines usually include many defaults that can be changed to customize the results . Useful command lines can be saved by assigning a character string or alias to represent the full command , or several commands can be grouped to perform a more complex sequence -- for instance , compile the program , install it , and run it -- creating a single entity , called a command procedure or script which itself can be treated as a command . These advantages mean that a user must figure out a complex command or series of commands only once , because they can be saved , to be used again . The commands given to a CLI shell are often in one of the following forms : doSomething how toFiles doSomething how sourceFile destinationFile doSomething how < inputFile > outputFile doSomething how doSomething how doSomething how > outputFile where doSomething is , in effect , a verb , how an adverb ( for example , should the command be executed `` verbosely '' or `` quietly '' ) and toFiles an object or objects ( typically one or more files ) on which the command should act . The > in the third example is a redirection operator , telling the command - line interpreter to send the output of the command not to its own standard output ( the screen ) but to the named file . This will overwrite the file . Using > > will redirect the output and append it to the file . Another redirection operator is the vertical bar ( ) , which creates a pipeline where the output of one command becomes the input to the next command . CLI and Resource protection ( edit ) One can modify the set of available commands by modifying which paths appear in the PATH environment variable . Under Unix , commands also need be marked as executable files . The directories in the path variable are searched in the order they are given . By re-ordering the path , one can run e.g. \\ OS2 \\ MDOS \\ E. EXE instead of \\ OS2 \\ E. EXE , when the default is the opposite . Renaming of the executables also works : people often rename their favourite editor to EDIT , for example . The command line allows one to restrict available commands , such as access to advanced internal commands . The Windows CMD. EXE does this . Often , shareware programs will limit the range of commands , including printing a command ' your administrator has disabled running batch files ' from the prompt . Some CLIs , such as those in network routers , have a hierarchy of modes , with a different set of commands supported in each mode . The set of commands are grouped by association with security , system , interface , etc . In these systems the user might traverse through a series of sub-modes . For example , if the CLI had two modes called interface and system , the user might use the command interface to enter the interface mode . At this point , commands from the system mode may not be accessible and the user exits the interface mode and enters the system mode . Command prompt ( edit ) `` Command prompt '' redirects here . For the Windows component named Command Prompt , see cmd. exe . A command prompt ( or just prompt ) is a sequence of ( one or more ) characters used in a command - line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands . It literally prompts the user to take action . A prompt usually ends with one of the characters $ , % , # , : , > and often includes other information , such as the path of the current working directory and the hostname . On many Unix and derivative systems , the prompt commonly ends in $ or % if the user is a normal user , but in # if the user is a superuser ( `` root '' in Unix terminology ) . End - users can often modify prompts . Depending on the environment , they may include colors , special characters , and other elements ( like variables and functions for the current time , user , shell number or working directory ) in order , for instance , to make the prompt more informative or visually pleasing , to distinguish sessions on various machines , or to indicate the current level of nesting of commands . On some systems , special tokens in the definition of the prompt can be used to cause external programs to be called by the command - line interpreter while displaying the prompt . In DOS 's COMMAND.COM and in Windows NT 's cmd. exe users can modify the prompt by issuing a PROMPT command or by directly changing the value of the corresponding % PROMPT % environment variable . The default of most modern systems , the C : \\ > style is obtained , for instance , with PROMPT $ P $ G . The default of older DOS systems , C > is obtained by just PROMPT , although on some systems this produces the newer C : \\ > style , unless used on floppy drives A : or B : ; on those systems PROMPT $ N $ G can be used to override the automatic default and explicitly switch to the older style . Many Unix systems feature the $ PS1 variable ( Prompt String 1 ) , although other variables also may affect the prompt ( depending on the shell used ) . In the bash shell , a prompt of the form : ( time ) user@host : work_dir $ could be set by issuing the command export PS1 = ' ( \\ t ) \\ u @ \\ H : \\ W $ ' In zsh the $ RPROMPT variable controls an optional `` prompt '' on the right - hand side of the display . It is not a real prompt in that the location of text entry does not change . It is used to display information on the same line as the prompt , but right - justified . In RISC OS the command prompt is a * symbol , and thus ( OS ) CLI commands are often referred to as `` star commands '' . One can also access the same commands from other command lines ( such as the BBC BASIC command line ) , by preceding the command with a * . Arguments ( edit ) An MS DOS command line , illustrating parsing into command and arguments A command - line argument or parameter is an item of information provided to a program when it is started . A program can have many command - line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information , or that alter the operation of the program . When a command processor is active a program is typically invoked by typing its name followed by command - line arguments ( if any ) . For example , in Unix and Unix - like environments , an example of a command - line argument is : rm file. s `` file. s '' is a command - line argument which tells the program rm to remove the file `` file. s '' . Some programming languages , such as C , C++ and Java , allow a program to interpret the command - line arguments by handling them as string parameters in the main function . Other languages , such as Python , expose these arguments as global variables . In Unix - like operating systems , a single hyphen - minus by itself is usually a special value specifying that a program should handle data coming from the standard input or send data to the standard output . Command - line option ( edit ) A command - line option or simply option ( also known as a flag or switch ) modifies the operation of a command ; the effect is determined by the command 's program . Options follow the command name on the command line , separated by spaces . A space before the first option is not always required , for example Dir \/ ? and DIR \/ ? have the same effect in DOS ( list the DIR command 's options ) whereas dir -- help ( in many versions of Unix ) does require the option to be preceded by at least one space ( and is case - sensitive ) . The format of options varies widely between operating systems . In most cases the syntax is by convention rather than an operating system requirement ; the entire command line is simply a string passed to a program , which can process it in any way the programmer wants , so long as the interpreter can tell where the command name ends and its arguments and options begin . A few representative samples of command - line options , all relating to listing files in a directory , to illustrate some conventions : Operating system Command Valid alternative Notes OpenVMS directory \/ owner Dir \/ Owner instruct the directory command to also display the ownership of the files . Note the Directory command name is not case sensitive , and can be abbreviated to as few letters as required to remain unique . DOS dir \/ Q \/ O :S d * diR \/ qd * \/ o :s display ownership of files whose names begin with `` D '' , sorted by size , smallest first . Note spaces around argument d * are required . Unix - like systems ls - lS D * ls - S - l D * display in long format files and directories beginning with `` D '' ( but not `` d '' ) , sorted by size ( largest first ) . Note spaces are required around all arguments and options , but some can be run together , e.g. - lS is the same as - l - S . Data General RDOS CLI list \/ e \/ s 04 - 26 - 80 \/ b List \/ S \/ E 4 - 26 - 80 \/ B list every attribute for files created before 26 April 1980 . Note the \/ B at the end of the date argument is a local switch , that modifies the meaning of that argument , while \/ S and \/ E are global switches , i.e. apply to the whole command . Abbreviating commands ( edit ) In Multics , command - line options and subsystem keywords may be abbreviated . This idea appears to derive from the PL \/ I programming language , with its shortened keywords ( e.g. , STRG for STRINGRANGE and DCL for DECLARE ) . For example , in the Multics `` forum '' subsystem , the - long_subject parameter can be abbreviated - lgsj . It is also common for Multics commands to be abbreviated , typically corresponding to the initial letters of the words that are strung together with underscores to form command names , such as the use of did for delete_iacl_dir . In some other systems abbreviations are automatic , such as permitting enough of the first characters of a command name to uniquely identify it ( such as SU as an abbreviation for SUPERUSER ) while others may have some specific abbreviations pre-programmed ( e.g. MD for MKDIR in COMMAND.COM ) or user - defined via batch scripts and aliases ( e.g. alias md mkdir in tcsh ) . See also : Tab completion . Option Conventions in DOS , Windows , OS \/ 2 ( edit ) On DOS , OS \/ 2 and Windows , different programs called from their COMMAND.COM or CMD. EXE ( or internal their commands ) may use different syntax within the same operating system . For example : Options may be indicated by either of the `` switch characters '' : - , \/ , or either may be allowed . See below . They may or may not be case - sensitive . Sometimes options and their arguments are run together , sometimes separated by whitespace , and sometimes by a character , typically : or = ; thus Prog - fFilename , Prog - f Filename , Prog - f : Filename , Prog - f = Filename . Some programs allow single - character options to be combined ; others do not . The switch - fA may mean the same as - f - A , or it may be incorrect , or it may even be a valid but different parameter . In DOS , OS \/ 2 and Windows , the forward slash ( \/ ) is most prevalent , although the hyphen - minus is also sometimes used . In many versions of DOS ( MS - DOS \/ PC DOS 2. xx and higher , all versions of DR - DOS since 5.0 , as well as PTS - DOS , Embedded DOS , FreeDOS and RxDOS ) the switch character ( sometimes abbreviated switchar or switchchar ) to be used is defined by a value returned from a system call ( INT 21h \/ AH = 37h ) . The default character returned by this API is \/ , but can be changed to a hyphen - minus on the above - mentioned systems , except for under Datalight ROM - DOS and MS - DOS \/ PC DOS 5.0 and higher , which always return \/ from this call ( unless one of many available TSRs to reenable the SwitChar feature is loaded ) . In some of these systems ( MS - DOS \/ PC DOS 2. xx , DOS Plus 2.1 , DR - DOS 7.02 and higher , PTS - DOS , Embedded DOS , FreeDOS and RxDOS ) , the setting can also be pre-configured by a SWITCHAR directive in CONFIG. SYS . General Software 's Embedded DOS provides a SWITCH command for the same purpose , whereas 4DOS allows the setting to be changed via SETDOS \/ W : n . Under DR - DOS , if the setting has been changed from \/ , the first directory separator \\ in the display of the PROMPT parameter $ G will change to a forward slash \/ ( which is also a valid directory separator in DOS , FlexOS , 4680 OS , 4690 OS , OS \/ 2 and Windows ) thereby serving as a visual clue to indicate the change . Some versions of DR - DOS COMMAND.COM also support a PROMPT token $ \/ to display the current setting . COMMAND.COM since DR - DOS 7.02 also provides a pseudo-environment variable named % \/ % to allow portable batchjobs to be written . Several external DR - DOS commands additionally support an environment variable % SWITCHAR % to override the system setting . However , many programs are hardwired to use \/ only , rather than retrieving the switch setting before parsing command - line arguments . A very small number , mainly ports from Unix - like systems , are programmed to accept `` - '' even if the switch character is not set to it ( for example netstat and ping , supplied with Windows , will accept the \/ ? option to list available options , and yet the list will specify the `` - '' convention ) . Option Conventions in Unix - like systems ( edit ) This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( April 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In Unix - like systems , the ASCII hyphen - minus begins options ; the new ( and GNU ) convention is to use two hyphens then a word ( e.g. -- create ) to identify the option 's use while the old convention ( and still available as an option for frequently - used options ) is to use one hyphen then one letter ( e.g. , - c ) ; if one hyphen is followed by two or more letters it may mean two options are being specified , or it may mean the second and subsequent letters are a parameter ( such as filename or date ) for the first option . Two hyphen - minus characters without following letters ( -- ) may indicate that the remaining arguments should not be treated as options , which is useful for example if a file name itself begins with a hyphen , or if further arguments are meant for an inner command ( e.g. , sudo ) . Double hyphen - minuses are also sometimes used to prefix `` long options '' where more descriptive option names are used . This is a common feature of GNU software . The getopt function and program , and the getopts command are usually used for parsing command - line options . Unix command names , arguments and options are case - sensitive ( except in a few examples , mainly where popular commands from other operating systems have been ported to Unix ) . Options Conventions in other systems ( edit ) FlexOS , 4680 OS and 4690 OS use - . CP \/ M typically used ( . Conversational Monitor System ( CMS ) uses a single left parenthesis to separate options at the end of the command from the other arguments . For example , in the following command the options indicate that the target file should be replaced if it exists , and the date and time of the source file should be retained on the copy : COPY source file a target file b ( REPLACE OLDDATE Data General 's CLI under their RDOS , AOS , etc. operating systems , as well as the version of CLI that came with their Business Basic , uses only \/ as the switch character , is case - insensitive , and allows `` local switches '' on some arguments to control the way they are interpreted , such as MAC \/ U LIB \/ SABC $ LPT \/ L has the global option `` U '' to the macro assembler command to appemd user symbols , but two local switches , one to specify LIB should be skipped on pass 2 and the other to direct listing to the printer , $ LPT . Built - in usage help ( edit ) See also : help ( command ) One of the criticisms of a CLI is the lack of cues to the user as to the available actions . In contrast , GUIs usually inform the user of available actions with menus , icons , or other visual cues . To overcome this limitation , many CLI programs display a brief summary of its valid parameters , typically when invoked with no arguments or one of ? , - ? , - h , - H , \/ ? , \/ h , \/ H , - help , or -- help . However , entering a program name without parameters in the hope that it will display usage help can be hazardous , as some programs and scripts execute without further notice . Although desirable at least for the help parameter , programs may not support all option lead - in characters exemplified above . Under DOS , where the default command - line option character can be changed from \/ to - , programs may query the SwitChar API in order to determine the current setting . So , if a program is not hard - wired to support them all , a user may need to know the current setting even to be able to reliably request help . If the SwitChar has been changed to - and therefore the \/ character is accepted as alternative path delimiter also at the DOS command line , programs may misinterpret options like \/ h or \/ H as paths rather than help parameters . However , if given as first or only parameter , most DOS programs will , by convention , accept it as request for help regardless of the current SwitChar setting . In some cases , different levels of help can be selected for a program . Some programs supporting this allow to give a verbosity level as an optional argument to the help parameter ( as in \/ H : 1 , \/ H : 2 , etc . ) or they give just a short help on help parameters with question mark and a longer help screen for the other help options . Depending on the program , additional or more specific help on accepted parameters is sometimes available by either providing the parameter in question as an argument to the help parameter or vice versa ( as in \/ H : W or in \/ W : ? ( assuming \/ W would be another parameter supported by the program ) ) . In a similar fashion to the help parameter , but much less common , some programs provide additional information about themselves ( like mode , status , version , author , license or contact information ) when invoked with an `` about '' parameter like - ! , \/ ! , - about , or -- about . Since the ? and ! characters typically also serve other purposes at the command line , they may not be available in all scenarios , therefore , they should not be the only options to access the corresponding help information . If more detailed help is necessary than provided by a program 's built - in internal help , many systems support a dedicated external `` HELP command '' command ( or similar ) , which accepts a command name as calling parameter and will invoke an external help system . In the DR - DOS family , typing \/ ? or \/ H at the COMMAND.COM prompt instead of a command itself will display a dynamically generated list of available internal commands ; 4DOS and NDOS support the same feature by typing ? at the prompt ( which is also accepted by newer versions of DR - DOS COMMAND.COM ) ; internal commands can be individually disabled or reenabled via SETDOS \/ I . In addition to this , some newer versions of DR - DOS COMMAND.COM also accept a ? % command to display a list of available built - in pseudo-environment variables . Besides their purpose as quick help reference this can be used in batchjobs to query the facilities of the underlying command - line processor . Command description syntax ( edit ) Built - in usage help and man pages commonly employ a small syntax to describe the valid command form : angle brackets for required parameters : ping < hostname > square brackets for optional parameters : mkdir ( - p ) < dirname > ellipses for repeated items : cp < source1 > ( source2 ... ) < dest > vertical bars for choice of items : netstat ( - t - u ) Notice that these characters have different meanings than when used directly in the shell . Angle brackets may be omitted when confusing the parameter name with a literal string is not likely . The space character ( edit ) In many areas of computing , but particularly in the command line , the space character can cause problems as it has two distinct and incompatible functions : as part of a command or parameter , or as a parameter or name separator . Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces in file and directory names in the first place ( for example , by substituting them with underscores _ ) , or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters or using an escape character before the space , usually a backslash ( \\ ) . For example Long path \/ Long program name Parameter one Parameter two ... is ambiguous ( is `` program name '' part of the program name , or two parameters ? ) ; however Long_path \/ Long_program_name Parameter_one Parameter_two ... , LongPath \/ LongProgramName ParameterOne ParameterTwo ... , `` Long path \/ Long program name '' `` Parameter one '' `` Parameter two '' ... and Long \\ path \/ Long \\ program \\ name Parameter \\ one Parameter \\ two ... are not ambiguous . Unix - based operating systems minimize the use of embedded spaces to minimize the need for quotes . In Microsoft Windows , one often has to use quotes because embedded spaces ( such as in directory names ) are common . Command - line interpreter ( edit ) See also : List of command - line interpreters Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter , it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command . Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution , it is a strange language , shaped as much by history as by design . -- Brian Kernighan & Rob Pike The terms command - line interpreter ( abbreviated CLI ) , command - line shell , or command language interpreter ( also abbreviated CLI ) are applied to computer programs designed to interpret a sequence of lines of text which may be entered by a user , read from a file or another kind of data stream . The context of interpretation is usually one of a given operating system or programming language . Command - line interpreters allow users to issue various commands in a very efficient ( and often terse ) way . This requires the user to know the names of the commands and their parameters , and the syntax of the language that is interpreted . The Unix # ! mechanism and OS \/ 2 EXTPROC command facilitate the passing of batch files to external processors . One can use these mechanisms to write specific command processors for dedicated uses , and process external data files which reside in batch files . Many graphical interfaces , such as the OS \/ 2 Presentation Manager and early versions of Microsoft Windows use command - lines to call helper programs to open documents and programs . The commands are stored in the graphical shell or in files like the registry or the OS \/ 2 os2user. ini file . Early history ( edit ) The earliest computers did not support interactive input \/ output devices , often relying on sense switches and lights to communicate with the computer operator . This was adequate for batch systems that ran one program at a time , often with the programmer acting as operator . This also had the advantage of low overhead , since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction . Later a single system console was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system . From the 1960s onwards , user interaction with computers was primarily by means of command - line interfaces , initially on machines like the Teletype Model 33 ASR , but then on early CRT - based computer terminals such as the VT52 . All of these devices were purely text based , with no ability to display graphic or pictures . For business application programs , text - based menus were used , but for more general interaction the command line was the interface . Around 1964 Louis Pouzin introduced the concept and the name shell in Multics , building on earlier , simpler facilities in the Compatible Time - Sharing System ( CTSS ) . From the early 1970s the Unix operating system adapted the concept of a powerful command - line environment , and introduced the ability to pipe the output of one command in as input to another . Unix also had the capability to save and re-run strings of commands as `` shell scripts '' which acted like custom commands . The command - line was also the main interface for the early home computers such as the Commodore PET , Apple II and BBC Micro -- almost always in the form of a BASIC interpreter . When more powerful business oriented microcomputers arrived with CP \/ M and later DOS computers such as the IBM PC , the command - line began to borrow some of the syntax and features of the Unix shells such as globbing and piping of output . The command - line was first seriously challenged by the PARC GUI approach used in the 1983 Apple Lisa and the 1984 Apple Macintosh . A few computer users used GUIs such as GEOS and Windows 3.1 but the majority of IBM PC users did not replace their COMMAND.COM shell with a GUI until Windows 95 was released in 1995 . Modern usage as an operating system shell ( edit ) While most non-expert computer users now use a GUI almost exclusively , more advanced users have access to powerful command - line environments : The default VAX \/ VMS command shell , using the DCL language , has been ported to Windows systems at least three times , including PC - DCL and Acceler8 DCL Lite . Unix command shells have been ported to VMS and DOS \/ Windows 95 and Windows NT types of operating systems . COMMAND.COM and Windows NT cmd. exe have been ported to Windows CE and presumably works on Microsoft Windows NT Embedded 4.0 Windows Resource Kit and Windows Services for Unix include Korn and the Bourne shells along with a Perl interpreter ( Services of Unix contains Active State ActivePerl in later versions and Interix for versions 1 and 2 and a shell compiled by Microsoft ) IBM OS \/ 2 has the cmd. exe processor . This copies the COMMAND.COM commands , with extensions to REXX . cmd. exe and COMMAND.COM are part of the Windows NT stream of operating systems . Yet another cmd. exe is a stripped - down shell for Windows CE 3.0 . An MS - DOS type interpreter called PocketDOS has been ported to Windows CE machines ; the most recent release is almost identical to MS - DOS 6.22 and can also run Windows 1 , 2 , and 3.0 , QBasic and other development tools , 4NT and 4DOS . The latest release includes several shells , namely MS - DOS 6.22 , PC DOS 7 , DR DOS 3. xx , and others PocketConsole is a Windows NT 4.0 shell for Windows CE that is much like 4NT . Windows users have a CLI environment named Windows Command Prompt , which might use the CScript interface to alternate programs . PowerShell provides a command - line interface , but its applets are not written in Shell script . Implementations of the Unix shell are also available as part of the POSIX sub-system , Cygwin , MKS Toolkit , UWIN , Hamilton C shell and other software packages . Available shells for these interoperability tools include csh , ksh , sh , bash , rsh , tclsh and less commonly zsh , ysh , psh COMMAND.COM ( 4DOS ) , Windows NT cmd. exe ( 4NT , TCC ) , and OS \/ 2 cmd. exe ( 4OS2 ) and others based on them are enhanced shells which can be a replacement for the native shell or a means of enhancement of the default shell Implementations of PHP have a shell for interactive use called php - cli . Standard Tcl \/ Tk has two interactive shells , Tclsh and Wish , the latter being the GUI version . Python , Ruby , Lua , XLNT , and other interpreters also have command shells for interactive use . FreeBSD uses tcsh as its default interactive shell for the superuser . Apple macOS and many Linux distributions have the Bash implementation of the Unix shell . Early versions of macOS used tcsh as the default shell . Embedded Linux ( and other embedded Unix - like ) devices often use the Ash implementation of the Unix shell , as part of Busybox . Android uses the mksh shell , which replaces a shell derived from ash that was used in older Android versions , supplemented with commands from the separate toolbox binary . Routers with Cisco IOS , Junos and many others are commonly configured from the command line . Scripting ( edit ) Most command - line interpreters support scripting , to various extents . ( They are , after all , interpreters of an interpreted programming language , albeit in many cases the language is unique to the particular command - line interpreter . ) They will interpret scripts ( variously termed shell scripts or batch files ) written in the language that they interpret . Some command - line interpreters also incorporate the interpreter engines of other languages , such as REXX , in addition to their own , allowing the executing of scripts , in those languages , directly within the command - line interpreter itself . Conversely , scripting programming languages , in particular those with an eval function ( such as REXX , Perl , Python , Ruby or Jython ) , can be used to implement command - line interpreters and filters . For a few operating systems , most notably DOS , such a command interpreter provides a more flexible command - line interface than the one supplied . In other cases , such a command interpreter can present a highly customised user interface employing the user interface and input \/ output facilities of the language . Other command - line interfaces ( edit ) The command line provides an interface between programs as well as the user . In this sense , a command line is an alternative to a dialog box . Editors and databases present a command line , in which alternate command processors might run . On the other hand , one might have options on the command line , which opens a dialog box . The latest version of ' Take Command ' has this feature . DBase used a dialog box to construct command lines , which could be further edited before use . Programs like Basic , Diskpart , Edlin , and QBasic all provide command - line interfaces , some of which use the system shell . Basic is modeled on the default interface for 8 - bit Intel computers . Calculators can be run as command - line or dialog interfaces . Emacs provides a command - line interface in the form of its minibuffer . Commands and arguments can be entered using Emacs standard text editing support , and output is displayed in another buffer . There are a number of text mode games , like Adventure or King 's Quest 1 - 3 , which relied on the user typing commands at the bottom of the screen . One controls the character by typing commands like ' get ring ' or ' look ' . The program returns a text which describes how the character sees it , or makes the action happen . The text adventure The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , a piece of interactive fiction based on Douglas Adam 's book of the same name , is a teletype - style command - line game . The most notable of these interfaces is the standard streams interface , which allows the output of one command to be passed to the input of another . Text files can serve either purpose as well . This provides the interfaces of piping , filters and redirection . Under Unix , devices are files too , so the normal type of file for the shell used for stdin , stdout and stderr is a tty device file . Another command - line interface allows a shell program to launch helper programs , either to launch documents or start a program . The command is processed internally by the shell , and then passed on to another program to launch the document . The graphical interface of Windows and OS \/ 2 rely heavily on command - lines passed through to other programs -- console or graphical , which then usually process the command line without presenting a user - console . Programs like the OS \/ 2 E editor and some other IBM editors , can process command - lines normally meant for the shell , the output being placed directly in the document window . A web browser 's URL input field can be used as a command line . It can be used to `` launch '' web apps , access browser configuration , as well as perform a search . Google , which has been called `` the command line of the internet '' will perform a domain - specific search when it detects search parameters in a known format . This functionality is present whether the search is triggered from a browser field or on Google 's website .

Was the Command Line Natural user interface Notes ( edit ) Jump up ^ An example is the comprehensive internal help system of the DR - DOS 7.03 DEBUG command , which can be invoked via ? ? at the debug prompt ( rather than only the default ? overview ) . Specific help pages can be selected via ? n ( where n is the number of the page ) . Additionally , help for specific commands can be displayed by specifying the command name after ? , f.e. ? D will invoke help for the various dump commands ( like D etc . ) . Some of these features were already supported by the DR DOS 3.41 SID86 and GEMSID .

Notable difference : The Windows Server 2003 R2 documentation uses italic letters for `` Information that the user must supply '' , while the Server 2008 documentation uses angle brackets .

The new research found that the reduction in price levels due to Walmart resulted to savings for consumers of $287 billion in 2006 , equivalent to $957 per person and $2,500 per household . Logo designed in 2008 On June 30 , 2008 , Walmart unveiled the company 's new logo , which stylized the name as `` Walmart '' .

In March 2006 , Walmart sought to appeal to a more affluent demographic , with the opening of a new supercenter in Plano , Texas at the corner of Park Blvd. and the Dallas North Tollway which was intended to compete against stores that some viewed as more upscale and appealing . The new store features wooden floors , wider aisles , a sushi bar , a coffee \/ sandwich shop ( with free Wi - Fi Internet access ) , a Subway , and higher - end items such as microbrew beer , expensive wines , and high - end electronics . The exterior sports the less - common hunter green background behind the Walmart letters instead of the trademark blue . In response to the popularity of organic food supermarkets , such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats , Walmart announced plans in May 2006 , to increase the amount of organic food available in its stores . They announced that both conventionally grown and organic versions of certain products would be available , and the price of organic versions would not be more than 10 % over the price of conventionally grown products . Since Walmart is one of the nation 's largest grocery retailers , there was some concern expressed that their push to lower prices would not be sustainable for inexpensive organic food . Legal trouble ( edit ) Over the last decade or so Walmart has become involved in numerous lawsuits for a variety of reasons . The majority of the suits are class action lawsuits in which employees are suing for unpaid wages . They have also run into numerous discrimination cases in which employees are suing for being profiled out of money or out of jobs . For example , there were two separate cases , one in 2004 and one in 2005 , in which black employees were suing two different Walmarts for denying them jobs based on race . These became so popular that the reverend Jesse Jackson intervened and spoke during both of the proceedings . There are also many lawsuits in which women are suing Wal - Mart for discriminating against them . In one article written in 2004 USA today mentioned 32 different lawsuits that involved women suing Walmart . But still Walmart has prevailed . All of this has not had any effects on Walmart financially however , according to Fortune 500 , Walmart still had $351 billion in revenue ( $11 billion in profit ) in 2007 , a new high for the corporation . On December 3 , 2008 , the family of Walmart service worker Jdimytai Damour , who was killed by a stampede of shoppers frantically entering a Walmart store in Valley Stream , New York on Black Friday ( November 28 ) , filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the corporation ; Damour 's family alleged Walmart of encouraging a mass number of customers to come to the store simultaneously . In addition , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Walmart for `` ... inadequate crowd management following the Nov. 28 , 2008 , death of an employee at its Valley Stream , New York , store . The worker died of asphyxiation after being knocked to the ground and trampled by a crowd of about 2,000 shoppers who surged into the store for its annual ' Blitz Friday ' pre-holiday sales event . '' The company went on to spend an estimated $2 million in legal fees fighting OSHA 's $7,000 fine , because it apparently wished to prevent OSHA from establishing a precedent that would enable OSHA to influence Walmart 's crowd control measures in the future . Countries of operation ( edit ) As of October 2009 , Walmart stores operate in Argentina , Brazil , Canada , Chile , China , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , India , Japan , Mexico , Nicaragua , Puerto Rico , the United Kingdom , and the United States .

Ash Wednesday A cross of ashes \/ dust on a worshiper 's forehead Observed by Many Western Christians Observances Holy Mass , Service of worship , Divine Service , Divine Liturgy Placing of ashes on the head Date Wednesday in seventh week before Easter 2017 date March 1 2018 date February 14 2019 date March 6 2020 date February 26 Frequency Annual Related to Shrove Tuesday \/ Mardi Gras Carnival Lent Easter Ash Wednesday is a Christian holy day of prayer , fasting and repentance . It is preceded by Shrove Tuesday and falls on the first day of Lent , the six weeks of penitence before Easter . Ash Wednesday is observed by many Western Christians , including Anglicans , Lutherans , Old Catholics , Methodists , Presbyterians , Roman Catholics , and some Baptists . Ash Wednesday derives its name from the placing of repentance ashes on the foreheads of participants to either the words `` Repent , and believe in the Gospel '' or the dictum `` Remember that you are dust , and to dust you shall return . '' The ashes may be prepared by burning palm leaves from the previous year 's Palm Sunday celebrations . Because it is the first day of Lent , many Christians , on Ash Wednesday , often begin marking a Lenten calendar , praying a Lenten daily devotional , and abstaining from a luxury that they will not partake in until Easter Sunday arrives .

The First Council of Nic\u00e6a spoke of Lent as a period of fasting for forty days , in preparation for Eastertide . In many places , Christians historically abstained from food for a whole day until the evening , and at sunset , Western Christians traditionally broke the Lenten fast , which is often known as the Black Fast . In India and Pakistan , many Christians continue this practice of fasting until sunset on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday , with some fasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent . In the Roman Catholic Church , Ash Wednesday is observed by fasting , abstinence from meat , and repentance -- a day of contemplating one 's transgressions . On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday , Roman Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59 ( whose health enables them to do so ) are permitted to consume only one full meal , which may be supplemented by two smaller meals , which together should not equal the full meal . Some Catholics will go beyond the minimum obligations demanded by the Church and undertake a complete fast or a bread and water fast until sunset . Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also days of abstinence from meat ( mammals and fowl ) , as are all Fridays during Lent . Some Roman Catholics continue fasting throughout Lent , as was the Church 's traditional requirement , concluding only after the celebration of the Easter Vigil . Where the Ambrosian Rite is observed , the day of fasting and abstinence is postponed to the first Friday in the Ambrosian Lent , nine days later . Many Lutheran parishes teach communicants to fast on Ash Wednesday , with some people choosing to continue doing so throughout the entire season of Lent , especially on Good Friday . A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent recommends the Lutheran guideline to `` Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day , usually without meat '' . In the Anglican Communion , the entire forty days of Lent are designated days of fasting and abstinence in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer , with the Traditional Saint Augustine 's Prayer Book : A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion defining `` Fasting , usually meaning not more than a light breakfast , one full meal , and one half meal , on the forty days of Lent . '' The same text defines abstinence as refraining from flesh meat on all Fridays of the Church Year , except for those during Christmastide . The historic Methodist homilies regarding the Sermon on the Mount stress the importance of the Lenten fast , which begins on Ash Wednesday . The United Methodist Church therefore states that : There is a strong biblical base for fasting , particularly during the 40 days of Lent leading to the celebration of Easter . Jesus , as part of his spiritual preparation , went into the wilderness and fasted 40 days and 40 nights , according to the Gospels . Rev. Jacqui King , the minister of Nu Faith Community United Methodist Church in Houston explained the philosophy of fasting during Lent as `` I 'm not skipping a meal because in place of that meal I 'm actually dining with God '' . The Reformed Church in America describes Ash Wednesday as a day `` focused on prayer , fasting , and repentance . '' The liturgy for Ash Wednesday thus contains the following `` Invitation to Observe a Lenten Discipline '' read by the presider : We begin this holy season by acknowledging our need for repentance and our need for the love and forgiveness shown to us in Jesus Christ . I invite you , therefore , in the name of Christ , to observe a Holy Lent , by self - examination and penitence , by prayer and fasting , by practicing works of love , and by reading and reflecting on God 's Holy Word . Many of the Churches in the Reformed tradition retained the Lenten fast in its entirety , although it was made voluntary , rather than obligatory . Ashes ( edit ) A priest marks a cross of ashes on a worshipper 's forehead , the prevailing form in English - speaking countries . Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday , either by being sprinkled over their heads or , in English - speaking countries , more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross . The words ( based on Genesis 3 : 19 ) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are , `` Memento , homo , quia pulvis es , et in pulverem reverteris . '' ( `` Remember , man , that thou art dust , and to dust thou shalt return . '' ) This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great ( c. 540 -- 604 ) . In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite , an alternative formula ( based on Mark 1 : 15 ) was introduced and given first place `` Repent , and believe in the Gospel '' and the older formula was translated as `` Remember that you are dust , and to dust you shall return . '' The old formula , based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin , reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus , implicitly , of their need to repent in time . The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old . Various manners of placing the ashes on worshippers ' heads are in use within the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church , the two most common being to use the ashes to make a cross on the forehead and sprinkling the ashes over the crown of the head . Originally , the ashes were strewn over men 's heads , but , probably because women had their heads covered in church , were placed on the foreheads of women . In the Catholic Church the manner of imposing ashes depends largely on local custom , since no fixed rule has been laid down . Although the account of \u00c6lfric of Eynsham shows that in about the year 1000 the ashes were `` strewn '' on the head , the marking of the forehead is the method that now prevails in English - speaking countries and is the only one envisaged in the Occasional Offices of the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea , a publication described as `` noticeably Anglo - Catholic in character '' . In its ritual of `` Blessing of Ashes '' , this states that `` the ashes are blessed at the beginning of the Eucharist ; and after they have been blessed they are placed on the forehead of the clergy and people . '' The Ash Wednesday ritual of the Church of England , Mother Church of the Anglican Communion , contains `` The Imposition of Ashes '' in its Ash Wednesday liturgy . On Ash Wednesday , the Pope , the Bishop of Rome , traditionally takes part in a penitential procession from the Church of Saint Anselm to the Basilica of Santa Sabina , where , in accordance with the custom in Italy and many other countries , ashes are sprinkled on his head , not smudged on his forehead , and he places ashes on the heads of others in the same way . A woman receives a cross of ashes on Ash Wednesday outside an Episcopal church The Anglican ritual , used in Papua New Guinea states that , after the blessing of the ashes , `` the priest marks his own forehead and then the foreheads of the servers and congregation who come and kneel , or stand , where they normally receive the Blessed Sacrament . '' The corresponding Catholic ritual in the Roman Missal for celebration within Mass merely states : `` Then the Priest places ashes on the head of those present who come to him , and says to each one ... '' Pre-1970 editions had much more elaborate instructions about the order in which the participants were to receive the ashes , but again without any indication of the form of placing the ashes on the head . The 1969 revision of the Roman Rite inserted into the Mass the solemn ceremony of blessing ashes and placing them on heads , but also explicitly envisaged a similar solemn ceremony outside of Mass . The Book of Blessings contains a simple rite . While the solemn rite would normally be carried out within a church building , the simple rite could appropriately be used almost anywhere . While only a priest or deacon may bless the ashes , laypeople may do the placing of the ashes on a person 's head . Even in the solemn rite , lay men or women may assist the priest in distributing the ashes . In addition , laypeople take blessed ashes left over after the collective ceremony and place them on the head of the sick or of others who are unable to attend the blessing . ( In 2014 , Anglican Liverpool Cathedral likewise offered to impose ashes within the church without a solemn ceremony . ) In addition , those who attend such Catholic services , whether in a church or elsewhere , traditionally take blessed ashes home with them to place on the heads of other members of the family , and it is recommended to have envelopes available to facilitate this practice . At home the ashes are then placed with little or no ceremony . Unlike its discipline regarding sacraments , the Catholic Church does not exclude from receiving sacramentals , such as the placing of ashes on the head , those who are not Catholics and perhaps not even baptized . Even those who have been excommunicated and are therefore forbidden to celebrate sacramentals are not forbidden to receive them . After describing the blessing , the rite of Blessing and Distribution of Ashes ( within Mass ) states : `` Then the Priest places ashes on the heads of all those present who come to him . '' The Catholic Church does not limit distribution of blessed ashes to within church buildings and has suggested the holding of celebrations in shopping centres , nursing homes , and factories . Such celebrations presume preparation of an appropriate area and include readings from Scripture ( at least one ) and prayers , and are somewhat shorter if the ashes are already blessed . The Catholic Church and the Methodist Church say that the ashes should be those of palm branches blessed at the previous year 's Palm Sunday service , while a Church of England publication says they `` may be made '' from the burnt palm crosses of the previous year . These sources do not speak of adding anything to the ashes other than , for the Catholic liturgy , a sprinkling with holy water when blessing them . An Anglican website speaks of mixing the ashes with a small amount of holy water or olive oil as a fixative . Where ashes are placed on the head by smudging the forehead with a sign of the cross , many Christians choose to keep the mark visible throughout the day . The churches have not imposed this as an obligatory rule , and the ashes may even be wiped off immediately after receiving them ; but some Christian leaders , such as Lutheran pastor Richard P. Bucher and Catholic bishop Kieran Conry , recommend it as a public profession of faith . Morgan Guyton , a Methodist pastor and leader in the Red - Letter Christian movement , encourages Christians to wear their ashed cross throughout the day as an exercise of religious freedom . Ashes to Go ( edit ) Two Anglican priests distribute ashes to passerby in the American city of Boca Raton as part of the Ashes to Go movement Since 2007 , some members of major Christian Churches , including Anglicans , Catholics , Lutherans , and Methodists , have participated in the Ashes to Go program , in which clergy go outside of their churches to public places , such as downtowns , sidewalks and train stations , to distribute ashes to passersby , even to people waiting in their cars for a stoplight to change . The Anglican priest Emily Mellott of Calvary Church in Lombard took up the idea and turned it into a movement , stated that the practice was also an act of evangelism . Anglicans and Catholics in parts of the United Kingdom such as Sunderland , are offering Ashes to Go together : Marc Lyden - Smith , the priest of Saint Mary 's Church , stated that the ecumenical effort is a `` tremendous witness in our city , with Catholics and Anglicans working together to start the season of Lent , perhaps reminding those who have fallen away from the Church , or have never been before , that the Christian faith is alive and active in Sunderland . '' The Catholic Student Association of Kent State University , based at the University Parish Newman Center , offered ashes to university students who were going through the Student Center of that institution in 2012 , and Douglas Clark of St. Matthew 's Roman Catholic Church in Statesboro , among others , have participated in Ashes to Go . On Ash Wednesday 2017 , Father Paddy Mooney , the priest of St Patrick 's Roman Catholic Church in the Irish town of Glenamaddy , set up an Ashes to Go station through which commuters could drive and receive ashes from their car ; the parish church also had `` drive - through prayers during Lent with people submitting requests into a box left in the church grounds without having to leave their car '' . Reverend Trey Hall , pastor of Urban Village United Methodist Church , stated that when his local church offered ashes in Chicago `` nearly 300 people received ashes -- including two people who were waiting in their car for a stoplight to change . '' In 2013 , churches not only in the United States , but also at least one church each in the United Kingdom , Canada and South Africa , participated in Ashes to Go . Outside of their church building , Saint Stephen Martyr Lutheran Church in Canton offered Ashes to Go for `` believers whose schedules make it difficult to attend a traditional service '' in 2016 . In the United States itself 34 states and the District of Columbia had at least one church taking part . Most of these churches ( parishes ) were Episcopal , but there were also several Methodist churches , as well as Presbyterian and Catholic churches . Commination Office ( edit ) The chancel of Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church on Ash Wednesday 2015 ( the veiled altar cross and purple paraments are customary during Lent ) Robin Knowles Wallace states that the traditional Ash Wednesday church service includes Psalm 51 ( the Miserere ) , prayers of confession and the sign of ashes . No single one of the traditional services contains all of these elements . The Anglican church 's traditional Ash Wednesday service , titled A Commination , contains the first two elements , but not the third . On the other hand , the Catholic Church 's traditional service has the blessing and distribution of ashes but , while prayers of confession and recitation of Psalm 51 ( the first psalm at Lauds on all penitential days , including Ash Wednesday ) are a part of its general traditional Ash Wednesday liturgy , they are not associated specifically with the rite of blessing the ashes . The rite of blessing has acquired an untraditional weak association with that particular psalm only since 1970 , when it was inserted into the celebration of Mass , at which a few verses of Psalm 51 are used as a responsorial psalm . Coincidentally , it was only about the same time that in some areas Anglicanism resumed the rite of ashes . In the mid-16th century , the first Book of Common Prayer removed the ceremony of the ashes from the liturgy of the Church of England and replaced it with what would later be called the Commination Office . In that 1549 edition , the rite was headed : `` The First Day of Lent : Commonly Called Ash - Wednesday '' . The ashes ceremony was not forbidden , but was not included in the church 's official liturgy . Its place was taken by reading biblical curses of God against sinners , to each of which the people were directed to respond with Amen . The text of the `` Commination or Denouncing of God 's Anger and Judgments against Sinners '' begins : `` In the primitive Church there was a godly discipline , that , at the beginning of Lent , such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance , and punished in this world , that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord ; and that others , admonished by their example , might be the more afraid to offend . Instead whereof , until the said discipline may be restored again , ( which is much to be wished , ) it is thought good that at this time ( in the presence of you all ) should be read the general sentences of God 's cursing against impenitent sinners '' . In line with this , Joseph Hooper Maude wrote that the establishment of The Commination was due to a desire of the reformers `` to restore the primitive practice of public penance in church '' . He further stated that `` the sentences of the greater excommunication '' within The Commination corresponded to those used in the ancient Church . The Anglican Church 's Ash Wednesday liturgy , he wrote , also traditionally included the Miserere , which , along with `` what follows '' in the rest of the service ( lesser Litany , Lord 's Prayer , three prayers for pardon and final blessing ) , `` was taken from the Sarum services for Ash Wednesday '' . From the Sarum Rite practice in England the service took Psalm 51 and some prayers that in the Sarum Missal accompanied the blessing and distribution of ashes . In the Sarum Rite , the Miserere psalm was one of the seven penitential psalms that were recited at the beginning of the ceremony . In the 20th century , the Episcopal Church introduced three prayers from the Sarum Rite and omitted the Commination Office from its liturgy . Low Church Ceremonies ( edit ) In some of the low church traditions , other practices are sometimes added or substituted , as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day . For example , in one common variation , small cards are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess . These small cards are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned . Regional customs ( edit ) In Victorian era , theatres refrained from presenting costumed shows on Ash Wednesday , so they provided other entertainment , as mandated by the Church of England ( Anglican Church ) . Also , `` in Iceland , on Ash Wednesday children pin small bags of ashes on the back of some unsuspecting person '' . Biblical significance of ashes ( edit ) Ashes were used in ancient times to express grief . When Tamar was raped by her half - brother , `` she sprinkled ashes on her head , tore her robe , and with her face buried in her hands went away crying '' ( 2 Samuel 13 : 19 ) . The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults . In Job 42 : 3 -- 6 , Job says to God : `` I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee . Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . '' The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying : `` O daughter of my people , gird on sackcloth , roll in the ashes '' ( Jer 6 : 26 ) . The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God : `` I turned to the Lord God , pleading in earnest prayer , with fasting , sackcloth and ashes '' ( Daniel 9 : 3 ) . Just prior to the New Testament period , the rebels fighting for Jewish independence , the Maccabees , prepared for battle using ashes : `` That day they fasted and wore sackcloth ; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes '' ( 1 Maccabees 3 : 47 ; see also 4 : 39 ) . Examples of the practice among Jews are found in several other books of the Bible , including Numbers 19 : 9 , 19 : 17 , Jonah 3 : 6 , Book of Esther 4 : 1 , and Hebrews 9 : 13 . Jesus is quoted as speaking of the practice in Matthew 11 : 21 and Luke 10 : 13 : `` If the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago ( sitting ) in sackcloth and ashes . '' Christian use of ashes ( edit ) An 1881 Polish painting of a Roman Catholic priest sprinkling ashes on the heads of worshippers , the form prevailing in , for instance , Italy , Spain , and parts of Latin America Christians continued the practice of using ashes as an external sign of repentance . Tertullian ( c. 160 -- c. 225 ) said that confession of sin should be accompanied by lying in sackcloth and ashes . The historian Eusebius ( c. 260 \/ 265 -- 339 \/ 340 ) recounts how a repentant apostate covered himself with ashes when begging Pope Zephyrinus to readmit him to communion . John W. Fenton writes that `` by the end of the 10th century , it was customary in Western Europe ( but not yet in Rome ) for all the faithful to receive ashes on the first day of the Lenten fast . In 1091 , this custom was then ordered by Pope Urban II at the council of Benevento to be extended to the church in Rome . Not long after that , the name of the day was referred to in the liturgical books as `` Feria Quarta Cinerum '' ( i.e. , Ash Wednesday ) . '' The public penance that grave sinners underwent before being admitted to Holy Communion just before Easter lasted throughout Lent , on the first day of which they were sprinkled with ashes and dressed in sackcloth . When , towards the end of the first millennium , the discipline of public penance was dropped , the beginning of Lent , seen as a general penitential season , was marked by sprinkling ashes on the heads of all . This practice is found in the Gregorian Sacramentary of the late 8th century . About two centuries later , \u00c6lfric of Eynsham , an Anglo - Saxon abbot , wrote of the rite of strewing ashes on heads at the start of Lent . A Lutheran pastor distributes ashes to a communicant during a Divine Service The article on Ash Wednesday in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica says that , after the Protestant Reformation , the ashes ceremony was not forbidden in the Church of England , a statement that may explain the research by Blair Meeks that the Anglican tradition `` never lapsed in this observance '' . It was even prescribed under King Henry VIII in 1538 and under King Edward VI in 1550 , but it fell out of use in many areas after 1600 . In 1536 , the Ten Articles issued by authority of Henry VIII commended `` the observance of various rites and ceremonies as good and laudable , such as clerical vestments , sprinkling of holy water , bearing of candles on Candlemas - day , giving of ashes on Ash - Wednesday '' . After Henry 's death in January 1547 , Thomas Cranmer , within the same year , `` procured an order from the Council to forbid the carrying of candles on Candlemas - day , and the use of ashes on Ash - Wednesday , and of palms on Palm - Sunday , as superstitious ceremonies '' , an order that was issued only for the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury , of which Cranmer was archbishop . The Church Cyclop\u00e6dia states that the `` English office had adapted the very old Salisbury service for Ash - Wednesday , prefacing it with an address and a recital of the curses of Mount Ebal , and then with an exhortation uses the older service very nearly as it stood . '' The new Commination Office had no blessing of ashes and therefore , in England as a whole , `` soon after the Reformation , the use of ashes was discontinued as a ' vain show ' and Ash Wednesday then became only a day of marked solemnity , with a memorial of its original character in a reading of the curses denounced against impenitent sinners '' . The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America , in the 19th century , observed Ash Wednesday : `` as a day of fasting and humiliation , wherein we are publicly to confess our sins , meekly to implore God 's mercy and forgiveness , and humbly to intercede for the continuance of his favour '' . In the 20th century , the Book of Common Prayer provided prayers for the imposition of ashes . An Episcopal priest has an Ashes to Go station for commuters at the Metro - North Railroad in the American state of Connecticut Monte Canfield and Blair Meeks state that after the Protestant Reformation , Anglicans and Lutherans kept the rite of blessing and distributing ashes to the faithful on Ash Wednesday , and that the Protestant denominations that did not keep it encouraged its use `` during and after the ecumenical era that resulted in the Vatican II proclamations '' . Jack Kingsbury and Russell F. Anderson likewise state that the practice was continued among some Anglicans and Lutherans . On the other hand , Edward Traill Horn wrote : `` The ceremony of the distribution of the ashes was not retained by the reformers , whether Lutheran , Anglican or Reformed '' , although these denominations honored Ash Wednesday as the first day of Lent . Frank Senn , a liturgical scholar , has been quoted as saying : `` How and why the use of ashes fell out of Lutheran use is difficult to discern from the sources ... ( C ) hurch orders do n't specifically say not to use ashes ; they simply stopped giving direction for blessing and distributing them and eventually the pastors just stopped doing it . '' As part of the liturgical revival ushered in by the ecumenical movement , the practice was encouraged in Protestant churches , including the Methodist Church . It has also been adopted by Anabaptist and Reformed churches and some less liturgical denominations . The Eastern Orthodox churches generally do not observe Ash Wednesday , although in recent times , the creation of the Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate has led to the observance of Ash Wednesday among Western Orthodox parishes . In this tradition , ashes `` may be distributed outside of the mass or any liturgical service '' although `` commonly the faithful receive their ashes immediately before the Ash Wednesday mass '' . In Orthodoxy , historically , `` serious public sinners in the East also donned sackcloth , including those who made the Great Fast a major theme of their entire lives such as hermits and desert - dwellers . '' Byzantine Catholics , although in the United States use `` the same Gregorian calendar as the Roman Catholic rite '' , do not practice the distribution of ashes as it is `` not part of their ancient tradition '' . In the Ambrosian Rite , ashes are blessed and placed on the heads of the faithful not on the day that elsewhere is called Ash Wednesday , but at the end of Mass on the following Sunday , which in that rite inaugurates Lent , with the fast traditionally beginning on Monday , the first weekday of the Ambrosian Lent . Lent ( edit ) Ash Wednesday by Carl Spitzweg : the end of Carnival Ash Wednesday marks the start of a 40 - day period which is an allusion to the separation of Jesus in the desert to fast and pray . During this time he was tempted . Matthew 4 : 1 -- 11 , Mark 1 : 12 -- 13 , and Luke 4 : 1 -- 13 . While not specifically instituted in the Bible text , the 40 - day period of repentance is also analogous to the 40 days during which Moses repented and fasted in response to the making of the Golden calf. ( Exo. 34 : 27 -- 28 ) ( Jews today follow a 40 - day period of repenting in preparation for and during the High Holy Days from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur . ) Dates ( edit ) Ash Wednesday is exactly 46 days before Easter Sunday , a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon . The earliest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 4 February ( which is only possible during a common year with Easter on 22 March ) , which happened in 1598 , 1693 , 1761 and 1818 and will next occur in 2285 . The latest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 10 March ( when Easter Day falls on 25 April ) which occurred in 1666 , 1734 , 1886 and 1943 and will next occur in 2038 . Ash Wednesday has never occurred on Leap Year Day ( 29 February ) , and it will not occur as such until 2096 . The only other years of the third millennium that will have Ash Wednesday on 29 February are 2468 , 2688 , 2840 and 2992 . ( Ash Wednesday falls on 29 February only if Easter is on 15 April in a leap year starting on a Sunday . ) Observing churches ( edit ) A Methodist minister distributing ashes to confirmands kneeling at the chancel rails Ash Wednesday in 2016 A Lutheran clergyman distributes ashes during the Holy Mass at Nazareth Evangelical Lutheran Church in Cedar Falls , Iowa on Ash Wednesday ( 2017 ) These Christian Churches are among those that mark Ash Wednesday with a particular liturgy or service .

There are , however , a relatively small number of Orthodox Christians who follow the Western Rite ; these do observe Ash Wednesday , although often on a different day from the previously mentioned denominations , as its date is determined from the Orthodox calculation of Pascha , which may be as much as a month later than the Western observance of Easter . National no Smoking day ( edit ) In the Republic of Ireland , Ash Wednesday is National No Smoking Day . The date was chosen because quitting smoking ties in with giving up luxury for Lent . In the United Kingdom No Smoking Day was held for the first time on Ash Wednesday 1984 but is now fixed as the second Wednesday in March . Notes ( edit ) Jump up ^ Not all Catholics observe Ash Wednesday . Eastern Catholic Churches , who do not count Holy Week as part of Lent , begin the penitential season on Clean Monday , the Monday before Ash Wednesday , and Catholics who follow the Ambrosian Rite begin it on the First Sunday in Lent . Ashes are blessed and ceremonially distributed at the start of Lent throughout the Latin Church and in the Maronite Catholic Church and the Syro - Malabar Catholic Church . In the Ambrosian Rite , this is done at the end of the Sunday Mass or on the following day ( see Il Sussidiario , Giorno delle Ceneri : Cos'\u00e8 il rito delle Ceneri Archived 14 July 2014 at the Wayback Machine . & Sapere , Perch\u00e9 il Carnevale ambrosiano si festeggia in ritardo rispetto al resto d'Italia ?

It is the successor to PlayStation 2 , and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles . It was first released on November 11 , 2006 , in Japan , November 17 , 2006 , in North America , and March 23 , 2007 , in Europe and Australia . The PlayStation 3 mainly competed against consoles such as Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles . The console was first officially announced at E3 2005 , and was released at the end of 2006 . It was the first console to use Blu - ray Disc as its primary storage medium . The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services , including being the first to introduce Sony 's social gaming service , PlayStation Network , and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita , being able to remote control the console from the devices . In September 2009 , the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released . It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games . It was lighter and thinner than the original version , and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design , as well as a minor start - up change in software . A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012 , further refining and redesigning the console . The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover , particularly after the introduction of the Slim model . Its successor , the PlayStation 4 , was released later in November 2013 . On September 29 , 2015 , Sony confirmed that sales of the PlayStation 3 were to be discontinued in New Zealand , but the system remained in production in other markets . Shipments of new units to the United States ended in October 2016 . Heading into 2017 , Japan was the last territory where new units were still being produced until May 29 , 2017 when Sony confirmed the PlayStation 3 was discontinued in Japan .

A functional version of the system was not present there , nor at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005 , although demonstrations ( such as Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots ) were held at both events on software development kits and comparable personal computer hardware . Video footage based on the predicted PlayStation 3 specifications was also shown ( notably a Final Fantasy VII tech demo ) . The initial prototype shown in May 2005 featured two HDMI ports , three Ethernet ports and six USB ports ; however , when the system was shown again a year later at E3 2006 , these were reduced to one HDMI port , one Ethernet port and four USB ports , presumably to cut costs . Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console : a 20 GB model and a 60 GB model , priced at US $499 ( \u20ac 499 ) and US $599 ( \u20ac 599 ) , respectively . The 60 GB model was to be the only configuration to feature an HDMI port , Wi - Fi internet , flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver . Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release : November 11 , 2006 , for Japan and November 17 , 2006 , for North America and Europe . On September 6 , 2006 , Sony announced that PAL region PlayStation 3 launch would be delayed until March 2007 , because of a shortage of materials used in the Blu - ray drive . At the Tokyo Game Show on September 22 , 2006 , Sony announced that it would include an HDMI port on the 20 GB system , but a chrome trim , flash card readers , silver logo and Wi - Fi would not be included . Also , the launch price of the Japanese 20 GB model was reduced by over 20 % , and the 60 GB model was announced for an open pricing scheme in Japan . During the event , Sony showed 27 playable PS3 games running on final hardware . Launch Silver PlayStation 3 consoles on show in 2006 PlayStation 3 was first released in Japan on November 11 , 2006 , at 07 : 00 . According to Media Create , 81,639 PS3 systems were sold within 24 hours of its introduction in Japan . Soon after its release in Japan , PS3 was released in North America on November 17 , 2006 . Reports of violence surrounded the release of PS3 . A customer was shot , campers were robbed at gunpoint , customers were shot in a drive - by shooting with BB guns , and 60 campers fought over 10 systems . The console was originally planned for a global release through November , but at the start of September the release in Europe and the rest of the world was delayed until March . With it being a somewhat last - minute delay , some companies had taken deposits for pre-orders , at which Sony informed customers that they were eligible for full refunds or could continue the pre-order . On January 24 , 2007 , Sony announced that PlayStation 3 would go on sale on March 23 , 2007 , in Europe , Australia , the Middle East , Africa and New Zealand . The system sold about 600,000 units in its first two days . On March 7 , 2007 , the 60 GB PlayStation 3 launched in Singapore with a price of S $ 799 . The console was launched in South Korea on June 16 , 2007 , as a single version equipped with an 80 GB hard drive and IPTV . Slim model 120 GB Slim model Following speculation that Sony was working on a ' slim ' model , Sony officially announced the PS3 CECH - 2000 model on August 18 , 2009 , at the Sony Gamescom press conference . New features included a slimmer form factor , decreased power consumption , and a quieter cooling system . It was released in major territories by September 2009 . At the same time , a new logo was introduced for the console to replace the previous `` Spider - Man '' wordmarks ( named due to their use of the same font as the logos of Sony 's then - current Spider - Man films ) , with a new `` PS3 '' wordmark evoking the design of the PlayStation 2 wordmark replacing the capitalized PlayStation 3 lettering . Super Slim model 250GB Super Slim model In September 2012 at the Tokyo Game Show , Sony announced that a new , slimmer PS3 redesign ( CECH - 4000 ) was due for release in late 2012 and that it would be available with either a 250 GB or 500 GB hard drive . Three versions of the Super Slim model were revealed : one with a 500 GB hard drive , a second with a 250 GB hard drive which is not available in PAL regions , and a third with a 12 GB flash storage that was available in PAL regions , and in Canada . The storage of 12 GB model is upgradable with an official standalone 250 GB hard drive . A vertical stand was also released for the model . In the United Kingdom , the 500 GB model was released on September 28 , 2012 ; and the 12 GB model was released on October 12 , 2012 . In the United States , the PS3 Super Slim was first released as a bundled console . The 250 GB model was bundled with the Game of the Year edition of Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception and released on September 25 , 2012 ; and the 500 GB model was bundled with Assassin 's Creed III and released on October 30 , 2012 . In Japan , the black colored Super Slim model was released on October 4 , 2012 ; and the white colored Super Slim model was released on November 22 , 2012 . The Super Slim model is 20 percent smaller and 25 percent lighter than the Slim model and features a manual sliding disc cover instead of a motorized slot - loading disc cover of the Slim model . The white colored Super Slim model was released in the United States on January 27 , 2013 as part of the Instant Game Collection Bundle . The Garnet Red and Azurite Blue colored models were launched in Japan on February 28 , 2013 . The Garnet Red version was released in North America on March 12 , 2013 as part of the God of War : Ascension bundle with 500 GB storage and contained God of War : Ascension as well as the God of War Saga . The Azurite Blue model was released as a GameStop exclusive with 250GB storage . Games Main article : Lists of PlayStation 3 games PlayStation 3 launched in North America with 14 titles , with another three being released before the end of 2006 . After the first week of sales it was confirmed that Resistance : Fall of Man from Insomniac Games was the top - selling launch game in North America . The game was heavily praised by numerous video game websites , including GameSpot and IGN , both of whom awarded it their PlayStation 3 Game of the Year award for 2006 . Some titles missed the launch window and were delayed until early 2007 , such as The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , F.E.A.R. and Sonic the Hedgehog . During the Japanese launch , Ridge Racer 7 was the top - selling game , while Mobile Suit Gundam : Crossfire also fared well in sales , both of which were offerings from Namco Bandai Games . PlayStation 3 launched in Europe with 24 titles , including ones that were not offered in North American and Japanese launches , such as Formula One Championship Edition , MotorStorm and Virtua Fighter 5 . Resistance : Fall of Man and MotorStorm were the most successful titles of 2007 , and both games subsequently received sequels in the form of Resistance 2 and MotorStorm : Pacific Rift . At E3 2007 , Sony was able to show a number of their upcoming video games for PlayStation 3 , including Heavenly Sword , Lair , Ratchet & Clank Future : Tools of Destruction , Warhawk and Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune ; all of which were released in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 . It also showed off a number of titles that were set for release in 2008 and 2009 ; most notably Killzone 2 , Infamous , Gran Turismo 5 Prologue , LittleBigPlanet and SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation . A number of third - party exclusives were also shown , including the highly anticipated Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , alongside other high - profile third - party titles such as Grand Theft Auto IV , Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , Assassin 's Creed , Devil May Cry 4 and Resident Evil 5 . Two other important titles for PlayStation 3 , Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII , were shown at TGS 2007 in order to appease the Japanese market . Sony have since launched their budget range of PlayStation 3 titles , known as the Greatest Hits range in North America , the Platinum range in Europe and Australia and The Best range in Japan . Among the titles available in the budget range include Resistance : Fall of Man , MotorStorm , Uncharted : Drakes Fortune , Rainbow Six : Vegas , Call Of Duty 3 , Assassin 's Creed and Ninja Gaiden Sigma . As of October 2009 Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , Ratchet & Clank Future : Tools of Destruction , Devil May Cry 4 , Army of Two , Battlefield : Bad Company and Midnight Club : Los Angeles have also joined the list . As of March 31 , 2012 , there have been 595 million games sold for PlayStation 3 . The best selling PS3 games are Grand Theft Auto V , Gran Turismo 5 , The Last Of Us , Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception and Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves Stereoscopic 3D Main article : List of PlayStation 3 games with 3D support In December 2008 , the CTO of Blitz Games announced that it would bring stereoscopic 3D gaming and movie viewing to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 with its own technology . This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony 's own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show . Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future . Firmware update 3.30 officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in 3D , requiring a compatible display for use . System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films . While the game itself must be programmed to take advantage of the 3D technology , titles may be patched to add in the functionality retroactively . Titles with such patches include Wipeout HD , Pain , and Super Stardust HD . Hardware Main article : PlayStation 3 hardware The PlayStation 3 was the first console to include an HDMI port . PlayStation 3 is convex on its left side , with the PlayStation logo upright , when vertical ( the top side is convex when horizontal ) and has a glossy black finish . PlayStation designer Teiyu Goto stated that the Spider - Man - font - inspired logo `` was one of the first elements SCEI president Ken Kutaragi decided on and the logo may have been the motivating force behind the shape of PS3 '' . On March 22 , 2007 , SCE and Stanford University released the Folding@home software for PlayStation 3 . This program allows PS3 owners to lend the computing power of their consoles to help study the process of protein folding for disease research . Use in supercomputing Main article : PlayStation 3 cluster PS3 's hardware has also been used to build supercomputers for high - performance computing . Fixstars Solutions sells a version of Yellow Dog Linux for PlayStation 3 ( originally sold by Terra Soft Solutions ) . RapidMind produced a stream programming package for PS3 , but were acquired by Intel in 2009 . Also , on January 3 , 2007 , Dr. Frank Mueller , Associate Professor of Computer science at NCSU , clustered 8 PS3s . Mueller commented that the 256 MB of system RAM is a limitation for this particular application and is considering attempting to retrofit more RAM . Software includes : Fedora Core 5 Linux ppc64 , MPICH2 , OpenMP v 2.5 , GNU Compiler Collection and CellSDK 1.1 . As a more cost - effective alternative to conventional supercomputers , the U.S. military has purchased clusters of PS3 units for research purposes . Retail PS3 Slim units can not be used for supercomputing , because PS3 Slim lacks the ability to boot into a third - party OS . In December 2008 , a group of hackers used a cluster of 200 PlayStation 3 computers to crack SSL authentication . In November 2010 the Air Force Research Laboratory ( AFRL ) created a powerful supercomputer by connecting together 1,760 Sony PS3s which include 168 separate graphical processing units and 84 coordinating servers in a parallel array capable of performing 500 trillion floating - point operations per second ( 500 TFLOPS ) . As built the Condor Cluster was the 33rd largest supercomputer in the world and would be used to analyze high definition satellite imagery . Technical specifications Main article : PlayStation 3 technical specifications The RSX ' Reality Synthesizer ' on a PlayStation 3 motherboard PlayStation 3 features a slot - loading 2x speed Blu - ray Disc drive for games , Blu - ray movies , DVDs , CDs and other optical media . It was originally available with hard drives of 20 and 60 GB ( 20 GB model was not available in PAL regions ) but various sizes up to 500 GB have been made available since then ( see : model comparison ) . All PS3 models have user - upgradeable 2.5 '' SATA hard drives . PlayStation 3 uses the Cell microprocessor , designed by Sony , Toshiba and IBM , as its CPU , which is made up of one 3.2 GHz PowerPC - based `` Power Processing Element '' ( PPE ) and eight Synergistic Processing Elements ( SPEs ) . The eighth SPE is disabled to improve chip yields . Only six of the seven SPEs are accessible to developers as the seventh SPE is reserved by the console 's operating system . Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX ' Reality Synthesizer ' , which can produce resolutions from 480i \/ 576i SD up to 1080p HD . PlayStation 3 has 256 MB of XDR DRAM main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX . The system has Bluetooth 2.0 ( with support for up to seven Bluetooth devices ) , Gigabit Ethernet , USB 2.0 and HDMI 1.4 built in on all currently shipping models . Wi - Fi networking is also built - in on all but the 20 GB models , while a flash card reader ( compatible with Memory Stick , SD \/ MMC and CompactFlash \/ Microdrive media ) is built - in on 60 GB and CECHExx 80 GB models . Models Main article : PlayStation 3 models PlayStation 3 has been produced in various models : the original , the Slim , and the Super Slim . Successive models have added or removed various features . Controllers and accessories Main article : PlayStation 3 accessories DualShock 3 controller in hand Numerous accessories for the console have been developed . These accessories include the wireless Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers , the Logitech Driving Force GT , the Logitech Cordless Precision Controller , the BD Remote , the PlayStation Eye camera , and the PlayTV DVB - T tuner \/ digital video recorder accessory . At Sony 's E3 press conference in 2006 , the then standard wireless Sixaxis controller was announced . The controller was based on the same basic design as the PlayStation 2 's DualShock 2 controller but was wireless , lacked vibration capabilities , had a built - in accelerometer ( that could detect motion in three directional and three rotational axes ; six in total , hence the name Sixaxis ) and had a few cosmetic tweaks . At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show , Sony announced DualShock 3 ( trademarked DUALSHOCK 3 ) , a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as Sixaxis , but with vibration capability included . Hands - on accounts describe the controller as being noticeably heavier than the standard Sixaxis controller and capable of vibration forces comparable to DualShock 2 . It was released in Japan on November 11 , 2007 ; in North America on April 5 , 2008 ; in Australia on April 24 , 2008 ; in New Zealand on May 9 , 2008 ; in mainland Europe on July 2 , 2008 , and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on July 4 , 2008 . During E3 2009 , Sony unveiled plans to release a motion controller later to be named PlayStation Move at GDC 2010 . It was released on September 15 , 2010 , in Europe ; September 19 , 2010 , in North America and October 21 , 2010 , in Japan . On October 13 , 2010 , Sony announced an official surround sound system for PS3 through the official PlayStation YouTube channel . The PlayStation 3 can also use DualShock 4 controller initially via USB cable , but Firmware update 4.60 enabled wireless connection . Statistics regarding reliability Some original `` fat '' PS3 systems display a yellow light , indicating a non-specific failure . According to Ars Technica , the number of PlayStation 3 consoles that have experienced failure is well within the normal failure rates in the consumer electronics industry ; a 2009 study by SquareTrade , a warranty provider , found a two - year failure rate of 10 % for PlayStation 3s . In September 2009 , BBC 's Watchdog television program aired a report investigating the issue , calling it the `` yellow light of death '' ( YLOD ) . Among the consoles that experienced the failure , they found that it usually occurred 18 -- 24 months after purchase , while the standard Sony warranty covers one year after purchase . After this time period , PlayStation 3 owners can pay Sony a fixed fee for a refurbished console . Sony claimed that , according to its statistics of returned consoles , approximately 0.5 % of consoles were reported as showing the YLOD . In response to the televised report , Sony issued a document criticizing the program 's accuracy and conclusions ; specifically that the faults were evidence of a manufacturing defect . The document also complained that the report had been inappropriate in tone and might damage Sony 's brand name . Software Main articles : PlayStation 3 system software and List of PlayStation applications System software Sony has included the ability for the operating system , referred to as System Software , to be updated . The updates can be acquired in several ways : If PlayStation 3 has an active Internet connection , updates may be downloaded directly from the PlayStation Network to PlayStation 3 and subsequently installed . Systems with active Internet will automatically check online for software updates each time the console is started . Using an external PC , a user may download the update from the official PlayStation website , transfer it to portable storage media and install it on the system . Some game discs come with system software updates on the disc . This may be due to the game requiring the update in order to run . If so , the software may be installed from the disc . The original PlayStation 3 also included the ability to install other operating systems , such as Linux . This was not included in the newer slim models and was removed from all older PlayStation 3 consoles with the release of firmware update 3.21 in April 2010 . The functionality is now only available to users of original consoles who choose not to update their system software beyond version 3.15 or who have installed third - party , modified and unofficial versions of the firmware instead . Graphical user interface Main article : XrossMediaBar -- PlayStation 3 XMB The XrossMediaBar ( XMB ) used on the PS3 . The standard PlayStation 3 version of the XrossMediaBar ( pronounced Cross Media Bar , or abbreviated XMB ) includes nine categories of options . These are : Users , Settings , Photo , Music , Video , TV \/ Video Services , Game , Network , PlayStation Network and Friends ( similar to the PlayStation Portable media bar ) . TheTV \/ Video Services category is for services like Netflix and \/ or if PlayTV or torne is installed ; the first category in this section is `` My Channels '' , which lets users download various streaming services , including Sony 's own streaming services Crackle and PlayStation Vue . By default , the What 's New section of PlayStation Network is displayed when the system starts up . PS3 includes the ability to store various master and secondary user profiles , manage and explore photos with or without a musical slide show , play music and copy audio CD tracks to an attached data storage device , play movies and video files from the hard disk drive , an optical disc ( Blu - ray Disc or DVD - Video ) or an optional USB mass storage or Flash card , compatibility for a USB keyboard and mouse and a web browser supporting compatible - file download function . Additionally , UPnP media will appear in the respective audio \/ video \/ photo categories if a compatible media server or DLNA server is detected on the local network . The Friends menu allows mail with emoticon and attached picture features and video chat which requires an optional PlayStation Eye or EyeToy webcam . The Network menu allows online shopping through the PlayStation Store and connectivity to PlayStation Portable via Remote Play . Digital rights management PlayStation 3 console protects certain types of data and uses digital rights management to limit the data 's use . Purchased games and content from the PlayStation Network store are governed by PlayStation 's Network Digital Rights Management ( NDRM ) . The NDRM allows users to access the data from up to 2 different PlayStation 3 's that have been activated using a user 's PlayStation Network ID . PlayStation 3 also limits the transfer of copy protected videos downloaded from its store to other machines and states that copy protected video `` may not restore correctly '' following certain actions after making a backup such as downloading a new copy protected movie . Photo management Photo Gallery Photo Gallery main menu Photo Gallery is an optional application to view , create and group photos from PS3 , which is installed separately from the system software at 105 MB . It was introduced in system software version 2.60 and provides a range of tools for sorting through and displaying the system 's pictures . The key feature of this application is that it can organize photos into groups according to various criteria . Notable categorizations are colors , ages , or facial expressions of the people in the photos . Slideshows can be viewed with the application , along with music and playlists . The software was updated with the release of system software version 3.40 allowing users to upload and browse photos on Facebook and Picasa . PlayMemories Studio PlayMemories is an optional stereoscopic 3D ( and also standard ) photo viewing application , which is installed from the PlayStation Store at 956 MB . The application is dedicated specifically to 3D photos and features the ability to zoom into 3D environments and change the angle and perspective of panoramas . It requires system software 3.40 or higher ; 3D photos ; a 3D HDTV , and an HDMI cable for the 3D images to be viewed properly . Video services Video editor and uploader A new application was released as part of system software version 3.40 which allows users to edit videos on PlayStation 3 and upload them to the Internet . The software features basic video editing tools including the ability to cut videos and add music and captions . Videos can then be rendered and uploaded to video sharing websites such as Facebook and YouTube . Video on demand In addition to the video service provided by the Sony Entertainment Network , the PlayStation 3 console has access to a variety of third party video services , dependent on region : Since June 2009 , VidZone has offered a free music video streaming service in Europe , Australia and New Zealand . In October 2009 , Sony Computer Entertainment and Netflix announced that the Netflix streaming service would also be available on PlayStation 3 in the United States . A paid Netflix subscription was required for the service . The service became available in November 2009 . Initially users had to use a free Blu - ray disc to access the service ; however , in October 2010 the requirement to use a disc to gain access was removed . In April 2010 , support for MLB.tv was added , allowing MLB.tv subscribers to watch regular season games live in HD and access new interactive features designed exclusively for PSN . In November 2010 , access to the video and social networking site MUBI was enabled for European , New Zealand , and Australian users ; the service integrates elements of social networking with rental or subscription video streaming , allowing users to watch and discuss films with other users . Also in November 2010 the video rental service VUDU , NHL GameCenter Live , and subscription service Hulu Plus launched on PlayStation 3 in the United States . In August 2011 , Sony , in partnership with DirecTV , added NFL Sunday Ticket . Then in October 2011 , Best Buy launched an app for its CinemaNow service . In April 2012 , Amazon.com launched an Amazon Video app , accessible to Amazon Prime subscribers ( in the US ) . Upon reviewing the PlayStation and Netflix collaboration , Pocket - Lint said `` We 've used the Netflix app on Xbox too and , as good as it is , we think the PS3 version might have the edge here . '' and stated that having Netflix and LoveFilm on PlayStation is `` mind - blowingly good . '' In July 2013 , YuppTV OTT player launched its branded application on the PS3 computer entertainment system in the United States . OtherOS support Main article : OtherOS PlayStation 3 initially shipped with the ability to install an alternative operating system alongside the main system software ; Linux and other Unix - based operating systems were available . The hardware allowed access to six of the seven Synergistic Processing Elements of the Cell microprocessor , but not the RSX ' Reality Synthesizer ' graphics chip . The ' OtherOS ' functionality was not present in the updated PS Slim models , and the feature was subsequently removed from previous versions of the PS3 as part of the machine 's firmware update version 3.21 which was released on April 1 , 2010 ; Sony cited security concerns as the rationale . The firmware update 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network . The removal caused some controversy ; as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products , and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation . On December 8 , 2011 , U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg dismissed the last remaining count of the class action lawsuit ( other claims in the suit had previously been dismissed ) , stating : `` As a legal matter , ( ... ) plaintiffs have failed to allege facts or articulate a theory on which Sony may be held liable . '' As of January 2014 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partially reversed the dismissal and have sent the case back to the district court . Leap year bug On March 1 , 2010 ( UTC ) , many of the original `` fat '' PlayStation 3 models worldwide were experiencing errors related to their internal system clock . The error had many symptoms . Initially , the main problem seemed to be the inability to connect to the PlayStation Network . However , the root cause of the problem was unrelated to the PlayStation Network , since even users who had never been online also had problems playing installed offline games ( which queried the system timer as part of startup ) and using system themes . At the same time many users noted that the console 's clock had gone back to December 31 , 1999 . The event was nicknamed the ApocalyPS3 , a play on the word apocalypse and PS3 , the abbreviation for the PlayStation 3 console . The error code displayed was typically 8001050F and affected users were unable to sign in , play games , use dynamic themes and view \/ sync trophies . The problem only resided within the 1st through to the 3rd generation original PS3 units while the newer `` Slim '' models were unaffected because of different internal hardware for the clock . Sony confirmed that there was an error and stated that it was narrowing down the issue and were continuing to work to restore service . By March 2 ( UTC ) , 2010 , owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31 , 1999 . Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a leap year , because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date . However , for some users , the hardware 's operating system clock ( mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the internal clock ) needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet . On June 29 , 2010 , Sony released PS3 system software update 3.40 , which improved the functionality of the internal clock to properly account for leap years . Features PlayStation Portable connectivity Main articles : Remote Play and PlayStation Store ( PC ) for PSP PlayStation Portable can connect with PlayStation 3 in many ways , including in - game connectivity . For example , Formula One Championship Edition , a racing game , was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real - time rear - view mirror . In addition , users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store , transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself . It is also possible to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games , remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection . Sony has also demonstrated PSP playing back video content from PlayStation 3 hard disk across an ad hoc wireless network . This feature is referred to as Remote Play located under the browser icon on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable . Remote play has since expanded to allow remote access to PS3 via PSP from any wireless access point in the world . PlayStation Network Main article : PlayStation Network PlayStation Network is the unified online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service provided by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable , announced during the 2006 PlayStation Business Briefing meeting in Tokyo . The service is always connected , free , and includes multiplayer support . The network enables online gaming , the PlayStation Store , PlayStation Home and other services . PlayStation Network uses real currency and PlayStation Network Cards as seen with the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Home . PlayStation Plus Main article : PlayStation Plus PlayStation Plus ( commonly abbreviated PS+ and occasionally referred to as PSN Plus ) is a premium PlayStation Network subscription service that was officially unveiled at E3 2010 by Jack Tretton , President and CEO of SCEA . Rumors of such service had been in speculation since Kaz Hirai 's announcement at TGS 2009 of a possible paid service for PSN but with the current PSN service still available . Launched alongside PS3 firmware 3.40 and PSP firmware 6.30 on June 29 , 2010 , the paid - for subscription service provides users with enhanced services on the PlayStation Network , on top of the current PSN service which is still available with all of its features . These enhancements include the ability to have demos and game updates download automatically to PlayStation 3 . Subscribers also get early or exclusive access to some betas , game demos , premium downloadable content and other PlayStation Store items . North American users also get a free subscription to Qore . Users may choose to purchase either a one - year or a three - month subscription to PlayStation Plus . PlayStation Store Main article : PlayStation Store The PlayStation Store is an online virtual market available to users of Sony 's PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) and PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) game consoles via the PlayStation Network . The Store offers a range of downloadable content both for purchase and available free of charge . Available content includes full games , add - on content , playable demos , themes and game and movie trailers . The service is accessible through an icon on the XMB on PS3 and PSP . The PS3 store can also be accessed on PSP via a Remote Play connection to PS3 . The PSP store is also available via the PC application , Media Go . As of September 24 , 2009 , there have been over 600 million downloads from the PlayStation Store worldwide . The PlayStation Store is updated with new content each Tuesday in North America , and each Wednesday in PAL regions . In May 2010 this was changed from Thursdays to allow PSP games to be released digitally , closer to the time they are released on UMD . What 's new What 's New was announced at Gamescom 2009 and was released on September 1 , 2009 , with PlayStation 3 system software 3.0 . The feature was to replace the existing ( Information Board ) , which displayed news from the PlayStation website associated with the user 's region . The concept was developed further into a major PlayStation Network feature , which interacts with the ( Status Indicator ) to display a ticker of all content , excluding recently played content ( currently in North America and Japan only ) . The system displays the What 's New screen by default instead of the ( Games ) menu ( or ( Video ) menu , if a movie was inserted ) when starting up . What 's New has four sections : `` Our Pick '' , `` Recently Played '' , latest information and new content available in PlayStation Store . There are four kinds of content the What 's New screen displays and links to , on the sections . `` Recently Played '' displays the user 's recently played games and online services only , whereas , the other sections can contain website links , links to play videos and access to selected sections of the PlayStation Store . The PlayStation Store icons in the ( Game ) and ( Video ) section act similarly to the What 's New screen , except that they only display and link to games and videos in the PlayStation Store , respectively . PlayStation Home Main article : PlayStation Home PlayStation Home was a virtual 3D social networking service for the PlayStation Network . Home allowed users to create a custom avatar , which could be groomed realistically . Users could edit and decorate their personal apartments , avatars , or club houses with free , premium , or won content . Users could shop for new items or win prizes from PS3 games , or Home activities . Users could interact and connect with friends and customize content in a virtual world . Home also acted as a meeting place for users that wanted to play multiplayer games with others . A closed beta began in Europe from May 2007 and expanded to other territories soon after . Home was delayed and expanded several times before initially releasing . The Open Beta test was started on December 11 , 2008 . It remained as a perpetual beta until its closure on March 31 , 2015 . Home was available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar . Membership was free , but required a PSN account . Home featured places to meet and interact , dedicated game spaces , developer spaces , company spaces , and events . The service underwent a weekly maintenance and frequent updates . At the time of its closure in March 2015 , Home had been downloaded by 41 million users . Life with PlayStation The Life with PlayStation application showing weather forecasts and news headlines for New York City . Screenshot taken at approximately 8pm PST . Main article : Life with PlayStation Life with PlayStation , released on September 18 , 2008 to succeed Folding@home , was retired November 6 , 2012 . Life with PlayStation used virtual globe data to display news and information by city . Along with Folding@home functionality , the application provided access to three other information `` channels '' , the first being the Live Channel offering news headlines and weather which were provided by Google News , The Weather Channel , the University of Wisconsin -- Madison Space Science and Engineering Center , among other sources . The second channel was the World Heritage channel which offered historical information about historical sites . The third channel was the United Village channel . United Village was designed to share information about communities and cultures worldwide . An update allowed video and photo viewing in the application . The fourth channel was the U.S. exclusive PlayStation Network Game Trailers Channel for direct streaming of game trailers . Outage Main article : 2011 PlayStation Network outage On April 20 , 2011 , Sony shut down the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a prolonged interval , revealing on April 23 that this was due to `` an external intrusion on our system '' . Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken , including : names ; addresses ; countries ; email addresses ; birthdates ; PSN \/ Qriocity logins , passwords and handles \/ PSN online IDs . It also stated that it was possible that users ' profile data , including purchase history and billing address , and PlayStation Network \/ Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained . There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken , but the possibility could not be ruled out , and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained . Additionally , the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number from the back of the credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions . In response to the incident , Sony announced a `` Welcome Back '' program , 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members , two free downloadable PS3 games , and a free one - year enrollment in an identity theft protection program . Sales and production costs Region units sold First available Canada `` about 1.5 million '' as of October 6 , 2010 November 17 , 2006 Europe ( Includes UK and other PAL regions ) 30 million as of December 19 , 2012 March 23 , 2007 Japan 6,341,950 as of April 1 , 2011 November 11 , 2006 United Kingdom 5 million as of October 11 , 2012 March 23 , 2007 United States 13.5 million as of November 11 , 2010 November 17 , 2006 Worldwide 80 million ( as of November 2 , 2013 ) November 11 , 2006 ( details ) Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony , PlayStation 3 had an inauspicious start , and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes . The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation 's most successful console in terms of units sold . Furthermore , PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start , and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series ( regarding cross-platform games , Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006 , although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed ) , and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360 . Sony also continued to lose money on each PS3 sold through 2010 , although the redesigned `` slim '' PS3 has cut these losses since then . PlayStation 3 's initial production cost is estimated by iSuppli to have been US $ 805.85 for the 20 GB model and US $840.35 for the 60 GB model . However , they were priced at US $499 and US $599 respectively , meaning that units may have been sold at an estimated loss of $306 or $241 depending on model , if the cost estimates were correct , and thus may have contributed to Sony 's games division posting an operating loss of \u00a5 232.3 billion ( US $1.97 billion ) in the fiscal year ending March 2007 . In April 2007 , soon after these results were published , Ken Kutaragi , President of Sony Computer Entertainment , announced plans to retire . Various news agencies , including The Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that this was due to poor sales , while SCEI maintains that Kutaragi had been planning his retirement for six months prior to the announcement . In January 2008 , Kaz Hirai , CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment , suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009 , stating that , `` the next fiscal year starts in April and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing '' and that `` ( profitability ) is not a definite commitment , but that is what I would like to try to shoot for '' . However , market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008 . In a July 2008 interview , Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year , surpassing PlayStation 2 's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market . In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008 . Since the system 's launch , production costs have been reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the Emotion Engine chip and falling hardware costs . The cost of manufacturing Cell microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process , and Blu - ray Disc diodes have become cheaper to manufacture . As of January 2008 , each unit cost around $400 to manufacture ; by August 2009 , Sony had reduced costs by a total of 70 % , meaning it only costs Sony around $240 per unit . Critical reception Early PlayStation 3 reviews after launch were critical of its high price and lack of quality games . Game developers regarded the architecture as difficult to program for . PS3 was , however , commended for its hardware including its Blu - ray home theater capabilities and graphics potential . Critical and commercial reception to PS3 improved over time , after a series of price revisions , Blu - ray 's victory over HD DVD , and the release of several well received titles . Ars Technica 's original launch review gave PS3 only a 6 \/ 10 , but second review of the console in June 2008 rated it a 9 \/ 10 . In September 2009 , IGN named PlayStation 3 the 15th best gaming console of all time , behind both of its competitors : Wii ( 10th ) and Xbox 360 ( 6th ) . However , PS3 has won IGN 's `` Console Showdown '' -- based on which console offers the best selection of games released during each year -- in three of the four years since it began ( 2008 , 2009 and 2011 , with Xbox winning in 2010 ) . IGN judged PlayStation 3 to have the best game line - up of 2008 , based on their review scores in comparison to those of Wii and Xbox 360 . In a comparison piece by PC Magazine 's Will Greenwald in June 2012 , PS3 was selected as an overall better console compared to Xbox 360 . Pocket - lint said of the console `` The PS3 has always been a brilliant games console , '' and that `` For now , this is just about the best media device for the money . '' Original model PS3 was given the number - eight spot on PC World magazine 's list of `` The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006 '' , where it was criticized for being `` Late , Expensive and Incompatible '' . GamesRadar ranked PS3 as the top item in a feature on game - related PR disasters , asking how Sony managed to `` take one of the most anticipated game systems of all time and -- within the space of a year -- turn it into a hate object reviled by the entire internet '' , but added that despite its problems the system has `` untapped potential '' . Business Week summed up the general opinion by stating that it was `` more impressed with what ( the PlayStation 3 ) could do than with what it currently does '' . Developers also found the machine difficult to program for . In 2007 , Gabe Newell of Valve said `` The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels , I think it 's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted '' . He continued `` I 'd say , even at this late date , they should just cancel it and do a do over . Just say , ' This was a horrible disaster and we 're sorry and we 're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it ' '' . Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects . He later restated Valve 's position , `` Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together , until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that , I do n't really see us moving to that platform '' . At Sony 's E3 2010 press conference , Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements , citing Sony 's move to make the system more developer friendly , and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system . He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks ( Valve 's system to automatically update their software independently ) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market . Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has criticized PS3 's high development costs and inferior attach rate and return to that of Xbox 360 and Wii . He believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console . In an interview with The Times Kotick stated `` I 'm getting concerned about Sony ; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they do n't make it easy for me to support the platform . '' He continued , `` It 's expensive to develop for the console , and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better . Games generate a better return on invested capital ( ROIC ) on the Xbox than on the PlayStation . '' Kotick also claimed that Activision Blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed . `` ( Sony has ) to cut the ( PS3 's retail ) price , because if they do n't , the attach rates are likely to slow . If we are being realistic , we might have to stop supporting Sony . '' Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement , notably from developer BioWare who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move , and referred to the statement as `` silly . '' Despite the initial negative press , several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware . CNET United Kingdom praised the system saying , `` the PS3 is a versatile and impressive piece of home - entertainment equipment that lives up to the hype ( ... ) the PS3 is well worth its hefty price tag . '' CNET awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10 and voted it as its number one `` must - have '' gadget , praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games . In addition , both Home Theater Magazine and Ultimate AV have given the system 's Blu - ray playback very favorable reviews , stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone Blu - ray Disc players . In an interview , Kazuo Hirai , chairman of Sony Computer Entertainment argued for the choice of a complex architecture . Hexus Gaming reviewed the PAL version and summed the review up by saying , `` as the PlayStation 3 matures and developers start really pushing it , we 'll see the PlayStation 3 emerge as the console of choice for gaming . '' At GDC 2007 , Shiny Entertainment founder Dave Perry stated , `` I think that Sony has made the best machine . It 's the best piece of hardware , without question '' . Slim model and rebranding The PlayStation 3 Slim received extremely positive reviews as well as a boost in sales ; less than 24 hours after its announcement , PS3 Slim took the number - one bestseller spot on Amazon.com in the video games section for fifteen consecutive days . It regained the number - one position again one day later . PS3 Slim also received praise from PC World giving it a 90 out of 100 praising its new repackaging and the new value it brings at a lower price as well as praising its quietness and the reduction in its power consumption . This is in stark contrast to the original PS3 's launch in which it was given position number - eight on their `` The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006 '' list . CNET awarded PS3 Slim four out of five stars praising its Blu - ray capabilities , 120 GB hard drive , free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point , but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for PlayStation 2 games . TechRadar gave PS3 Slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating `` Over all , the PS3 Slim is a phenomenal piece of kit . It 's amazing that something so small can do so much '' . However , they criticized the exterior design and the build quality in relation to the original model . Eurogamer called it `` a product where the cost - cutting has -- by and large -- been tastefully done '' and said `` It 's nothing short of a massive win for Sony . '' Super Slim model The Super Slim model of PS3 has received positive reviews . Gaming website Spong praised the new Super Slim 's quietness , stating `` The most noticeable noise comes when the drive seeks a new area of the disc , such as when starting to load a game , and this occurs infrequently . '' They added that the fans are quieter than that of Slim , and went on to praise the new smaller , lighter size . Criticism was placed on the new disc loader , stating : `` The cover can be moved by hand if you wish , there 's also an eject button to do the work for you , but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar ( XMB ) interface . In addition , you have to close the cover by hand , which can be a bit fiddly if it 's upright , and the PS3 wo n't start reading a disc unless you do ( close the cover ) . '' They also said there is no real drop in retail price . Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars ( `` Excellent '' ) , saying `` The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors : a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services ( ... ) '' , whilst also criticising the `` cheap '' design and disc - loader , stating : `` Sometimes ( the cover ) does n't catch and you feel like you 're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines . In short , it feels cheap . You do n't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they 're gone . Whether it was to cut costs or save space , this move is ultimately a step back . '' The criticism also was due to price , stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model , and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive should n't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced . They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is `` the easiest yet . Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay , which can quickly be unscrewed . '' They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade , it could be an indicator as to what 's to come . `` It may not be revolutionary , but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package . There does n't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade , but for the prospective PS3 buyer , the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot - loading disc drive . '' Pocket - Lint gave Super Slim a very positive review saying `` It 's much more affordable , brilliant gaming , second - to - none video and media player . '' They think it is `` A blinding good console and one that will serve you for years to come with second - hand games and even new releases . Without doubt , if you do n't have a PS3 , this is the time to buy . '' They gave Super Slim 4 and a half stars out of 5 . Technology magazine T3 gave the Super Slim model a positive review , stating the console is almost `` nostalgic '' in the design similarities to the original `` fat '' model , `` While we do n't know whether it will play PS3 games or Blu - ray discs any differently yet , the look and feel of the new PS3 Slim is an obvious homage to the original PS3 , minus the considerable excess weight . Immediately we would be concerned about the durability of the top loading tray that feels like it could be yanked straight out off the console , but ultimately it all feels like Sony 's nostalgic way of signing off the current generation console in anticipation for the PS4 .
