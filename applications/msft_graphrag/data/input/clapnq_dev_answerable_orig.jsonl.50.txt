( July 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) 1980s -- 1990s ( edit ) Johnston 's musical work gained some notability when he moved to Austin , Texas . Johnston began to attract the attention of the local press and gained a following augmented in numbers by his habit of handing out tapes to people he met . Live performances were well - attended and hotly anticipated . His local standing led to him being featured in a 1985 episode of the MTV program The Cutting Edge featuring performers from Austin 's `` New Sincerity '' music scene . Subsequently , he performed at the 1985 Woodshock music festival in Austin and was featured in the short documentary Woodshock . In 1988 , Johnston visited New York City and recorded 1990 with producer Kramer at his Noise New York studio . It was released in 1990 on Kramer 's Shimmy - Disc label . This was Johnston 's first experience in a professional recording environment after a decade of releasing home - made cassette recordings . His mental health further deteriorated during the making of 1990 . In 1989 , Johnston released the album It 's Spooky in collaboration with Half Japanese singer Jad Fair . In 1990 , Johnston played at a music festival in Austin , Texas . On the way back to West Virginia on a private two - seater plane piloted by his father Bill , Johnston had a manic psychotic episode ; believing he was Casper the Friendly Ghost , Johnston removed the key from the plane 's ignition and threw it outside . His father , a former US Air Force pilot , managed to successfully crash - land the plane , even though `` there was nothing down there but trees '' . Although the plane was destroyed , Johnston and his father emerged with only minor injuries . As a result of this episode , Johnston was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital . Interest in Johnston increased when Kurt Cobain was frequently photographed wearing a T - shirt featuring the cover image of Johnston 's album Hi , How Are You that music journalist Everett True gave him . Kurt Cobain listed Yip \/ Jump Music as one of his favorite albums in his journal in 1993 . In spite of Johnston being resident in a mental hospital at the time , there was a bidding war to sign him . He refused to sign a multi-album deal with Elektra Records because Metallica was on the label 's roster and he was convinced that they were of Satan and would hurt him . He also dropped his manager after having a psychotic episode at a Butthole Surfers concert . Ultimately he signed with Atlantic Records in February 1994 and that September released Fun , produced by Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers . It was a commercial failure . In June 1996 , Atlantic dropped Daniel from the label . Johnston 's `` Hi , How Are You '' mural in Austin , Texas . In 1993 , the Sound Exchange record store in Austin , Texas commissioned Johnston to paint a mural of the Hi , How Are You ? frog ( also known as `` Jeremiah the Innocent '' ) from the album 's cover . After the record store closed in 2003 , the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when a Mexican grill franchise called Baja Fresh took ownership and decided to remove the wall that held the mural . A group of people who lived in the neighborhood convinced the managers and contractors to keep the mural intact . As of 2018 , the building houses a Thai restaurant called `` Thai , How Are You '' . Johnston contributed two songs to the soundtrack for Larry Clark 's controversial 1995 film Kids , produced by Folk Implosion and Sebadoh 's frontman , Lou Barlow . Johnston later covered Schoolhouse Rock ! 's `` Unpack Your Adjectives '' for a compilation of the popular education songs called Schoolhouse Rock ! Rocks in 1996 . 2000s ( edit ) In 2004 , he released The Late Great Daniel Johnston : Discovered Covered , a two - disc compilation . The first disc featured covers of his songs by artists including Tom Waits , Beck , TV on the Radio , Jad Fair , Eels , Bright Eyes , Calvin Johnson , Death Cab for Cutie , Sparklehorse , Mercury Rev , The Flaming Lips and Starlight Mints .

Johnston in 2006 A 2005 Dutch documentary about Johnston for the TV series R.A.M. was followed in 2006 by The Devil and Daniel Johnston . Jeff Feuerzeig 's documentary , four years in the making , collated some of the vast amount of recorded material Johnston ( and in some case , others ) had produced over the years to portray his life and music . The film won high praise , receiving the Director 's Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival . The film also inspired more interest in Johnston 's work , and increased his prestige as a touring artist . In 2006 , Johnston 's label , Eternal Yip Eye Music , released his first greatest - hits compilation , Welcome to My World . He appeared as musical guest on The Henry Rollins Show , performing `` Mask '' and `` Care Less '' ( the latter was exclusive to the Internet ) .

His artwork was shown in galleries such as in London 's Aquarium Gallery , New York 's Clementine Gallery and at the Liverpool Biennial in 2006 and 2008 , and in 2009 , his work was exhibited at `` The Museum of Love '' at Verge Gallery in Sacramento , California . In 2008 , Dick Johnston , Daniel 's brother and manager , revealed that `` a movie deal based on the artist 's life and music had been finalized with a tentative 2011 release . '' He also said that a deal had been struck with the Converse company for a `` signature series '' Daniel Johnston shoe . Later , it was revealed by Dick Johnston that Converse had dropped the plan . In early 2008 , a Jeremiah the Innocent collectible figurine was released in limited runs of four different colors . Later in the year , Adjustable Productions released Johnston 's first concert DVD , The Angel and Daniel Johnston -- Live at the Union Chapel , featuring a 2007 appearance in Islington , London .

Johnston performed a brief solo set before being joined on stage by Cage , who backed performances of several songs , including `` Speeding Motorcycle '' and `` True Love Will Find You in the End '' . Also that year , Dr. Fun Fun and Smashing Studios developed an iPhone platform game called Hi , How Are You . The game is similar to Frogger , but features Johnston 's art and music .

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( December 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The University of Alabama is a school with many traditions . This article describes several of these traditions . Contents ( hide ) 1 Football 1.1 Beginnings of football at Alabama 1.2 The Crimson Tide 1.3 The Elephant 2 The Million Dollar Band 2.1 Naming of the Million Dollar Band 2.2 Directors of the Million Dollar Band 3 School songs 3.1 Alma Mater 3.2 `` Yea Alabama '' 4 Rammer Jammer Cheer 5 References 6 External links Football ( edit ) Beginnings of football at Alabama ( edit ) According to a November 25 , 1926 article in The Crimson White , football was first introduced at the University of Alabama in 1892 by W.G. Little of Livingston , Alabama , who had been a student at Andover , Massachusetts and `` went to the University for the game . '' Alabama 's first football game was played in Birmingham on Friday afternoon , November 11 , 1892 , at the old Lakeview Park . Alabama defeated a team composed mostly of high schoolers 56 - 0 . That Saturday , November 12 , Alabama played the Birmingham Athletic Club , losing 5 - 4 when Ross , of B.A.C. , kicked a 65 - yard field goal . This field goal was a collegiate record at the time . In 1896 the University 's board of trustees passed a rule forbidding athletic teams from traveling off - campus . The following season only one game was played and in 1898 football was abandoned at Alabama . Student opposition to the ruling forced trustees to lift the travel ban and football was resumed in 1899 . The 1918 season was cancelled on account of World War I but the game was resumed the following year . Alabama first gained national recognition for football in 1922 when it defeated the University of Pennsylvania 9 - 7 in Philadelphia . The following season Wallace Wade became head coach and in 1925 led the Crimson Tide to its first undefeated and untied season and its first trip to Pasadena , California with a Rose Bowl invitation . On January 1 , 1926 in the Rose Bowl , Alabama came from behind to upset the University of Washington 20 - 19 . The Crimson Tide ( edit ) Early newspaper accounts of the University 's football squad simply referred to them as the `` varsity '' or the `` Crimson White '' . The first nickname popular with the media was the `` Thin Red Line '' , which was used until 1906 . Hugh Roberts , former sports editor of the Birmingham Age - Herald , is credited with coining the phrase `` Crimson Tide '' in an article describing the 1907 Iron Bowl played in Birmingham with Auburn a heavy favorite to win . The game was played in a sea of red mud which stained the Alabama white jerseys crimson . The elephant ( edit ) There are two stories , perhaps both true , about how Alabama 's football squad became associated with the elephant , both dating to the coaching tenure of Wallace Wade ( 1923 -- 1930 ) . The earliest account attributes the Rosenberger 's Birmingham Trunk Company for the elephant association . Owner J.D. Rosenberger , whose son was a student at the University , outfitted the undefeated 1926 team with `` good luck '' luggage tags for the trip to the 1927 Rose Bowl . The company 's trademark , displayed on the tags , was a red elephant standing on a trunk . When the football team arrived in Pasadena , the reporters greeting them , including syndicated columnist Grantland Rice , associated their large size with the elephants on their luggage . When the 1930 team returned to the Rose Bowl , the company furnished leather suitcases , paid for by the Alumni Association , to each team member . Another story dates to 1930 . Following the October 4 game against Ole Miss , Atlanta Journal sports writer and Hall of Fame former Georgia Tech back Everett Strupper wrote : `` At the end of the quarter , the earth started to tremble , there was a distant rumble that continued to grow . Some excited fan in the stands bellowed , ' Hold your horses , the elephants are coming , ' and out stamped this Alabama varsity . It was the first time that I had seen it and the size of the entire eleven nearly knocked me cold , men that I had seen play last year looking like they had nearly doubled in size . '' Yet , despite the unofficial status as the Crimson Tide 's mascot , the elephant was very much part of the school 's football traditions by the 1940s . It was in that decade that a live elephant mascot named `` Alamite '' was a regular sight on game days in Tuscaloosa . For several years it was traditional for the pachyderm to lead the homecoming parade and Alamite would also bear that year 's queen onto the field prior to the game . Sports writers continued to refer to Alabama as the `` Red Elephants '' afterward , referring to their crimson jerseys . The 1930 team shut out eight of ten opponents , allowing a total of only 13 points all season . The `` Red Elephants '' rolled up 217 points that season , including a 24 - 0 victory over Washington State in the Rose Bowl . Despite these early associations of the elephant to the University of Alabama , the university did not officially accept the elephant as university mascot until 1979 . Alabama 's elephant mascot is known as `` Big Al '' . The Million Dollar Band ( edit ) Main article : Million Dollar Band ( marching band ) The Million Dollar Band performing at a football game The Million Dollar Band , the University of Alabama 's marching band , was founded in 1913 with 14 members under the direction of Dr. Gustav Wittig . In 1917 , the band became a military band and was led by students until 1927 . The Million Dollar Band is the largest performing organization on campus , with around 400 members . The September 1992 issue of Southern Living selected the Million Dollar Band as one of the top ten most outstanding bands in the South . In 2003 it became the twenty - second band to be honored with the Sudler Trophy , given by the Sousa Foundation to recognize `` collegiate marching bands of particular excellence that have made outstanding contributions to the American way of life . '' Additionally , the Million Dollar Band has been nationally televised more than any other college marching band in the country . Naming of the Million Dollar Band ( edit ) There are two stories to the naming of the Million Dollar Band . The main one is from a time when Alabama 's football was n't doing so well . They were playing Georgia Tech and the coach of Georgia Tech stated , `` Your football team is n't worth a nickel , but you have a million dollar band . '' And so the name stuck . In the second story , W.C. `` Champ '' Pickens bestowed the name `` Million Dollar Band '' after the 1922 football game against Georgia Tech . Though accounts vary , it is reported that in order for the band to attend the game they had to solicit funds from local businesses . They were able to collect enough funds to ride in a tourist sleeper to the game . After the game , which Alabama lost 33 - 7 , an Atlanta sportswriter commented to Pickens , `` You do n't have much of a team ; what do you have at Alabama ? '' Pickens replied , `` A Million Dollar Band . '' Directors of the Million Dollar Band ( edit ) 1913 -- 1917 : Gustav Wittig 1917 -- 1927 : Student - led 1927 -- 1934 : Captain H.H. Turner 1935 -- 1968 : Colonel Carleton K. Butler 1969 -- 1970 : Earl Dunn 1971 -- 1983 : James Ferguson 1984 -- 2002 : Kathryn B. Scott 2003 -- present : Kenneth Ozzello School songs ( edit ) Alma mater ( edit ) Like many college alma mater songs written around the turn of the 20th century , the Alabama Alma Mater is set to the tune of `` Annie Lisle '' , a ballad written in the 1850s . The words are usually credited as , `` Helen Vickers , 1908 '' , although it is not clear whether that was when it was written or if that was her graduating class . `` Yea Alabama '' ( edit ) Following Alabama 's 1926 Rose Bowl victory over Washington , a contest was held by The Rammer - Jammer , a student newspaper , for the composition of a fight song . Several entries were submitted to a panel overseen by the Music Department , and the winning entry , `` Yea Alabama '' , was adopted . The composer , Ethelred Lundy ( Epp ) Sykes , a student in the School of Engineering , was the editor of The Rammer - Jammer , and played piano in a jazz ensemble , The Capstone Five . He won the University 's Pan-Hellenic Cup in 1926 for overall achievement , both academically , athletically , and in student affairs . The song achieved considerable popularity during the 20s and 30s . Sykes went on to become a Brigadier General in the U.S Air Force , and donated the copyright and future royalties to the University in 1947 . The Million Dollar Band plays only the chorus at football games such as after touchdowns and field goals . A Dixieland jazz version of the song appeared on the 1950 Percy Faith album Football Songs ( later re-released as Touchdown ! ) and was played extensively across the state in the 1960s and 1970s as the music bed of radio commercials for sporting goods stores . It was also used as the theme music for The Bear Bryant Show . The last words of the song , `` Roll Tide ! '' , have become the standard cheer , greeting , and farewell among Alabama fans . The fight song , as played today , has been shortened to begin with the words `` Yea Alabama '' ; however , the original version had a verse that went at the beginning . The original version did not have `` Roll Tide , Roll Tide ! '' at the end , but was added as a chant immediately following the last line of the song . Amusingly , the song refers to several `` traditional '' opponents , but two of them are no longer part of Alabama 's opponent roster . Georgia Tech ( `` Yellow Jackets '' ) left the SEC in the early 1960s , and has only infrequently filled one of the non-conference game slots , and The University of the South Tigers ( also called Sewanee ) withdrew from the SEC in 1940 , de-emphasized athletics , and no longer competes at the Division I level . Georgia ( `` Bulldogs '' ) , like Alabama , is a member of the SEC , but the Crimson Tide and Bulldogs are in different divisions and play each other only once every six years , unless the schools meet in the SEC Championship Game . Rammer Jammer cheer ( edit ) The `` Rammer Jammer Cheer '' is a traditional cheer . The lyrics originate from The Rammer - Jammer , a student magazine in the 1920s , and the yellowhammer , Alabama 's state bird . The term `` yellowhammer '' was originally used to describe Confederate soldiers from Alabama who wore bright yellow cloth on their uniforms ; when the soldiers marched into the city of Hopkinsville , Kentucky , supporters of the Confederacy cheered them with the chant `` yellowhammer , yellowhammer . '' During and after the American Civil War , the term continued to be used and Alabama became known as the `` Yellowhammer State . '' The cadence of the cheer was adapted from the Ole Miss cheer `` Hotty Toddy '' after then Ole Miss marching band director Dr. James Ferguson was appointed director of the Million Dollar Band . The cheer was long referred to as `` Ole Miss '' , and today the drum major 's signal is still the motioning of one arm in a full circle ( an ' O ' ) . The cheer was a pregame ritual until the early 2000s , chanting `` We 're gon na ' beat the hell out of you ! '' , but this was considered unsportsmanlike and banned . The university also briefly forbade the Million Dollar Band from playing it after games , because of its taunting nature . The move was met with a significant amount of criticism . In a vote at Homecoming 2005 , the question was posed to students of whether the cheer should be banned . 98 % of students voted in favor of keeping the cheer . Before the university 's attempt to remove the cheer , it was played before kickoff and at the end of the game . The cheer is now only played in the closing minutes when victory is certain , and is traditionally chanted twice . On at least one occasion ( during Alabama 's victory over Auburn in the 2008 Iron Bowl , Alabama 's first in the series since 2001 ) , it was repeated an additional four times to signify the breaking of the 6 - game losing streak to Auburn . After Alabama 's victory over the Florida Gators in the 2009 SEC Championship Game , as well as after Alabama 's victory over the Texas Longhorns in the 2010 Citi BCS National Championship Game , the cheer was played nine times . Depending on what team Alabama is playing , the Million Dollar Band and fans will call out to the opposing team by chanting the team 's mascot with the exception being Auburn University ; they do not refer to them as the Tigers , just as Auburn . In other instances , the nickname of the opposing team is substituted ; for instance , a victory over the University of Tennessee would change the opening lyrics to `` Hey Vols ! '' ( short for Volunteers , the nickname \/ mascot for the University of Tennessee ) Also , when the cheer was played before kickoff , fans would replace the lyrics `` We just '' with `` We 're gon na . '' The cheer is no longer played before kickoff ; however , there are a few special occasions where the cheer is played before a football game . One such instance occurs when Alabama plays Tennessee in Knoxville . The night before the football game , the Alabama Alumni Association hosts a riverboat cruise in which Alabama alumni from all around reunite for a night . During the two trips the riverboat cruise takes over the course of the night , the Million Dollar Band members that are a part of the cruises ' pep band will play the Rammer Jammer cheer in the direction of other boats on the river flying a Volunteers ' flag . Author Warren St. John titled his 2004 bestseller about obsessive sports fans Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer after the cheer . The cheer was most noted during the years of Coach Paul `` Bear '' Bryant and his head cheerleader Mickey Grigsby .

{"document_plaintext":"Making out - wikipedia Making out Jump to : navigation , search `` Snog '' redirects here . For the Australian band , see Snog ( band ) . `` Petting '' redirects here . For stroking an animal , see Social grooming . For other uses of `` making out '' , see Make out ( disambiguation ) . A silhouette of a couple making out Making out is a term of American origin , dating back to at least 1949 , and is used variously to refer to kissing , petting , and necking , but may also refer to non-penetrative sex acts such as heavy petting . Snogging has roughly the same meaning in British English and some related varieties of English , except in Hiberno - English ( spoken in Ireland ) , where it is more commonly known as shifting . Contents ( hide ) 1 History 2 Characteristics 3 See also 4 References History ( edit ) The sexual connotations of the phrase `` make out '' appear to have developed in the 1930s and 1940s from the phrase 's other meanings of `` to succeed '' . Originally , it meant `` to seduce '' or `` to have sexual intercourse with '' . Studies indicate that at the beginning of the 20th century , premarital sex increased , and with it , petting behavior in the 1920s . The Continental experience at that time is amusingly illustrated by a letter that Sigmund Freud wrote to S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi in 1931 playfully admonishing him to stop kissing his patients , in which Freud warned lest `` a number of independent thinkers in matters of technique will say to themselves : Why stop at a kiss ? Certainly one gets further when one adopts ' pawing ' as well , which , after all , does n't make a baby . And then bolder ones will come along who will go further , to peeping and showing -- and soon we shall have accepted in the technique of analysis the whole repertoire of demi - viergerie and petting parties '' . By the postwar period , necking and petting became accepted behavior in mainstream American culture , as long as the partners were dating , and became the subject of numerous jokes : ' He : `` Darling , I 'm groping for words . '' She : `` You wo n't find them there . '' ( N.Y. 1940 ) ' . Characteristics ( edit ) Making out is usually considered an expression of affection or sexual attraction . An episode of making out is frequently referred to as a `` make - out session '' or simply `` making out , '' depending on the speaker 's vernacular . It covers a wide range of sexual behavior , and means different things to different age groups in different parts of the United States . It typically refers to kissing , including prolonged , passionate , open - mouth kissing ( also known as French kissing ) , and intimate skin - to - skin contact . The term can also refer to other forms of foreplay such as heavy petting , which typically involves some genital stimulation , but usually not the direct act of penetrative sexual intercourse . The perceived significance of making out may be affected by the age and relative sexual experience of the participants . Teenagers sometimes play party games in which making out is the main activity as an act of exploration . Games in this category include seven minutes in heaven and spin the bottle . Teenagers may have had social gatherings in which making out was the predominant event . In the United States , these events were referred to as `` make - out parties '' and would sometimes be confined to a specific area , called the `` make - out room '' . These make - out parties were generally not regarded as sex parties , though heavy petting may have been involved , depending on the group .

Lake Kariba is the world 's largest man - made lake and reservoir by volume . It lies 1300 kilometres upstream from the Indian Ocean , along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe . Lake Kariba was filled between 1958 and 1963 following the completion of the Kariba Dam at its northeastern end , flooding the Kariba Gorge on the Zambezi River . The Zimbabwean town of Kariba was built for construction workers on the lake 's dam , while some other settlements such as Binga village and Mlibizi in Zimbabwe and Siavonga and Sinazongwe in Zambia have grown up to house people displaced by the rising waters . Contents ( hide ) 1 Physical characteristics 2 Ecology 3 Protected areas 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Physical characteristics ( edit ) Lake Kariba is over 223 kilometres ( 139 miles ) long and up to 40 kilometres ( 25 miles ) in width . It covers an area of 5,580 square kilometres ( 6.01 \u00d7 10 square feet ) mi ) and its storage capacity is 185 cubic kilometres ( 44 cubic miles ) . The mean depth of the lake is 29 metres ( 95 feet ) ; the maximum depth is 97 metres ( 318 feet ) . It is the world 's largest man - made reservoir , four times as large as the Three Gorges Dam . The enormous mass of water ( approximately 180,000,000,000,000 kilograms , or 180 petagrams ( 200 billion tons ) ) is believed to have caused induced seismicity in the seismically active region , including over 20 earthquakes of greater than 5 magnitude on the Richter scale . The lake has several islands , including Maaze Island , Mashape Island , Chete Island , Sekula , Sampa Karuma , Fothergill , Spurwing , Snake Island , Antelope Island , Bed Island , and Chikanka . Ecology ( edit ) Kariba Dam Before Lake Kariba was filled , the existing vegetation was burned , creating a thick layer of fertile soil on land that would become the lake bed . As a result , the ecology of Lake Kariba is vibrant . A number of fish species have been introduced to the lake , notably the sardine - like kapenta ( transported from Lake Tanganyika ) , which now supports a thriving commercial fishery . Other inhabitants of Lake Kariba include Nile crocodiles and hippopotami . Gamefish , particularly tigerfish , which was among the indigenous species of the Zambezi river system , now thrive on the kapenta , which in turn encourages tourism . Both Zambia and Zimbabwe are now attempting to develop the tourism industry along their respective coasts of Lake Kariba . Fish eagles , cormorants and other water birds patrol the shorelines , as do occasional herds of elephants . Protected areas ( edit ) The portion of Lake Kariba which falls within Zimbabwe has been designated a Recreational Park within the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Estate .

It was the first major battle of the American Civil War . The Union 's forces were slow in positioning themselves , allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail . Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle . It was a Confederate victory , followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond , Virginia , which was expected to bring an early end to the rebellion . Yielding to political pressure , Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction . McDowell 's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men ; nevertheless , the Confederates , who had been planning to attack the Union left flank , found themselves at an initial disadvantage . Confederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad , and the course of the battle quickly changed . A brigade of Virginians under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute , Thomas J. Jackson , stood its ground , which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname , `` Stonewall '' . The Confederates launched a strong counterattack , and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire , many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout . McDowell 's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington , D.C. Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and many casualties , and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated . The Battle of First Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war . Units were committed piecemeal , attacks were frontal , infantry failed to protect exposed artillery , tactical intelligence was nil , and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively . McDowell , with 35,000 men , was only able to commit about 18,000 , and the combined Confederate forces , with about 32,000 men , committed only 18,000 .

On April 15 , 1861 , the day after South Carolina military forces attacked and captured Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor , President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation declaring an insurrection against the laws of the United States . Earlier , South Carolina and seven other Southern states had declared their secession from the Union and formed the Confederate States of America . To suppress the rebellion and restore Federal law in the Southern states , Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers with ninety - day enlistments to augment the existing U.S. Army of about 15,000 . He later accepted an additional 40,000 volunteers with three - year enlistments and increased the strength of the U.S. Army to almost 20,000 . Lincoln 's actions caused four more Southern states , including Virginia , to secede and join the Confederacy , and by 1 June the Confederate capital had been moved from Montgomery , Alabama , to Richmond , Virginia . In Washington , D.C. , as thousands of volunteers rushed to defend the capital , General in Chief Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott laid out his strategy to subdue the rebellious states . He proposed that an army of 80,000 men be organized and sail down the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans . While the Army `` strangled '' the Confederacy in the west , the U.S. Navy would blockade Southern ports along the eastern and Gulf coasts . The press ridiculed what they dubbed as Scott 's `` Anaconda Plan '' . Instead , many believed the capture of the Confederate capital at Richmond , only one hundred miles south of Washington , would quickly end the war . By July 1861 thousands of volunteers were camped in and around Washington . Since General Scott was seventy - five years old and physically unable to lead this force , the administration searched for a more suitable field commander . Lt. Gen.

Irvin McDowell ( edit ) Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase championed fellow Ohioan , 42 - year - old Maj . Irvin McDowell . Although McDowell was a West Point graduate , his command experience was limited . In fact , he had spent most of his career engaged in various staff duties in the Adjutant General 's Office . While stationed in Washington he had become acquainted with Chase , a former Ohio governor and senator . Now , through Chase 's influence , McDowell was promoted three grades to brigadier general in the Regular Army and on 27 May was assigned command ( by President Abraham Lincoln ) of the Department of Northeastern Virginia , which included the military forces in and around Washington ( Army of Northeastern Virginia ) . McDowell immediately began organizing what became known as the Army of Northeastern Virginia , 35,000 men arranged in five divisions . Under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations , McDowell was given very little time to train the newly inducted troops . Units were instructed in the maneuvering of regiments , but they received little or no training at the brigade or division level . He was reassured by President Lincoln , `` You are green , it is true , but they are green also ; you are all green alike . '' Against his better judgment , McDowell commenced campaigning . Intelligence ( edit ) During the previous year , U.S. Army captain Thomas Jordan set up a pro-Southern spy network in Washington City , including Rose O'Neal Greenhow , a prominent socialite with a wide range of contacts . He provided her with a code for messages . After he left to join the Confederate Army , he gave her control of his network but continued to receive reports from her . On July 9 and 16 , 1861 , Greenhow passed secret messages to Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard containing critical information regarding military movements for what would be the First Battle of Bull Run , including the plans of Union general McDowell . McDowell 's plan and initial movements in the Manassas Campaign ( edit ) On July 16 , 1861 , McDowell departed Washington with the largest field army yet gathered on the North American continent , about 35,000 men ( 28,452 effectives ) . McDowell 's plan was to move westward in three columns and make a diversionary attack on the Confederate line at Bull Run with two columns , while the third column moved around the Confederates ' right flank to the south , cutting the railroad to Richmond and threatening the rear of the Confederate army . He assumed that the Confederates would be forced to abandon Manassas Junction and fall back to the Rappahannock River , the next defensible line in Virginia , which would relieve some of the pressure on the U.S. capital . McDowell had hoped to have his army at Centreville by 17 July , but the troops , unaccustomed to marching , moved in starts and stops . Along the route soldiers often broke ranks to wander off to pick apples or blackberries or to get water , regardless of the orders of their officers to remain in ranks . The Confederate Army of the Potomac ( 21,883 effectives ) under Beauregard was encamped near Manassas Junction , approximately 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the United States capital . McDowell planned to attack this numerically inferior enemy army . Union Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson 's 18,000 men engaged Johnston 's force ( the Army of the Shenandoah at 8,884 effectives , augmented by Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes 's brigade of 1,465 ) in the Shenandoah Valley , preventing them from reinforcing Beauregard . Movements July 16 -- 21 , 1861 Situation July 18 Battlefield of Manassas After two days of marching slowly in the sweltering heat , the Union army was allowed to rest in Centreville . McDowell reduced the size of his army to approximately 31,000 by dispatching Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon with 5,000 troops to protect the army 's rear . In the meantime , McDowell searched for a way to outflank Beauregard , who had drawn up his lines along Bull Run . On July 18 , the Union commander sent a division under Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler to pass on the Confederate right ( southeast ) flank. Tyler was drawn into a skirmish at Blackburn 's Ford over Bull Run and made no headway . Also on the morning of 18 July Johnston had received a telegram suggesting he go to Beauregard 's assistance if possible . Johnston marched out of Winchester about noon , while Stuart 's cavalry screened the movement from Patterson . Patterson was completely deceived . One hour after Johnston 's departure Patterson telegraphed Washington , `` I have succeeded , in accordance with the wishes of the General - in - Chief , in keeping General Johnston 's force at Winchester . '' For the maneuver to be successful McDowell felt he needed to act quickly . He had already begun to hear rumors that Johnston had slipped out of the valley and was headed for Manassas Junction . If the rumors were true , McDowell might soon be facing 34,000 Confederates , instead of 22,000 . Another reason for quick action was McDowell 's concern that the ninety - day enlistments of many of his regiments were about to expire . `` In a few days I will lose many thousands of the best of this force '' , he wrote Washington on the eve of battle . In fact , the next morning two units of McDowell 's command , their enlistments expiring that day , would turn a deaf ear to McDowell 's appeal to stay a few days longer . Instead , to the sounds of battle , they would march back to Washington to be mustered out of service . Becoming more frustrated , McDowell resolved to attack the Confederate left ( northwest ) flank instead . He planned to attack with Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler 's division at the Stone Bridge on the Warrenton Turnpike and send the divisions of Brig . Gens . David Hunter and Samuel P. Heintzelman over Sudley Springs Ford . From here , these divisions could march into the Confederate rear . The brigade of Col. Israel B. Richardson ( Tyler 's Division ) would harass the enemy at Blackburn 's Ford , preventing them from thwarting the main attack . Patterson would tie down Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley so that reinforcements could not reach the area . Although McDowell had arrived at a theoretically sound plan , it had a number of flaws : it was one that required synchronized execution of troop movements and attacks , skills that had not been developed in the nascent army ; it relied on actions by Patterson that he had already failed to take ; finally , McDowell had delayed long enough that Johnston 's Valley force was able to board trains at Piedmont Station and rush to Manassas Junction to reinforce Beauregard 's men . Prelude to battle ( edit ) On July 19 -- 20 , significant reinforcements bolstered the Confederate lines behind Bull Run . Johnston arrived with all of his army , except for the troops of Brig. Gen. Kirby Smith , who were still in transit . Most of the new arrivals were posted in the vicinity of Blackburn 's Ford , and Beauregard 's plan was to attack from there to the north toward Centreville . Johnston , the senior officer , approved the plan . If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously , it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other 's left flank . McDowell was getting contradictory information from his intelligence agents , so he called for the balloon Enterprise , which was being demonstrated by Prof. Thaddeus S.C. Lowe in Washington , to perform aerial reconnaissance . Opposing forces ( edit ) Union ( edit ) Further information : Union order of battle Key Union commanders Brig. Gen .

Tyler 's division ( about 8,000 ) marched directly toward the Stone Bridge . The inexperienced units immediately developed logistical problems . Tyler 's division blocked the advance of the main flanking column on the turnpike . The later units found the approach roads to Sudley Springs were inadequate , little more than a cart path in some places , and did not begin fording Bull Run until 9 : 30 a.m. Tyler 's men reached the Stone Bridge around 6 a.m. At 5 : 15 a.m. , Richardson 's brigade fired a few artillery rounds across Mitchell 's Ford on the Confederate right , some of which hit Beauregard 's headquarters in the Wilmer McLean house as he was eating breakfast , alerting him to the fact that his offensive battle plan had been preempted . Nevertheless , he ordered demonstration attacks north toward the Union left at Centreville . Bungled orders and poor communications prevented their execution . Although he intended for Brig. Gen. Richard S. Ewell to lead the attack , Ewell , at Union Mills Ford , was simply ordered to `` hold ... in readiness to advance at a moment 's notice '' . Brig. Gen. D.R. Jones was supposed to attack in support of Ewell , but found himself moving forward alone . Holmes was also supposed to support , but received no orders at all . U.S. cavalry at Sudley Spring Ford An 1862 illustration of a Confederate officer forcing slaves to fire a cannon at U.S. forces at gunpoint . According to John Parker , a former slave , he was forced by his Confederate captors to fire a cannon at U.S. soldiers at the Battle of Bull Run . All that stood in the path of the 20,000 Union soldiers converging on the Confederate left flank were Col. Nathan `` Shanks '' Evans and his reduced brigade of 1,100 men . Evans had moved some of his men to intercept the direct threat from Tyler at the bridge , but he began to suspect that the weak attacks from the Union brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Schenck were merely feints . He was informed of the main Union flanking movement through Sudley Springs by Captain Edward Porter Alexander , Beauregard 's signal officer , observing from 8 miles ( 13 km ) southwest on Signal Hill . In the first use of wig - wag semaphore signaling in combat , Alexander sent the message `` Look out for your left , your position is turned . '' Evans hastily led 900 of his men from their position fronting the Stone Bridge to a new location on the slopes of Matthews Hill , a low rise to the northwest of his previous position . The Confederate delaying action on Matthews Hill included a spoiling attack launched by Major Roberdeau Wheat 's 1st Louisiana Special Battalion , `` Wheat 's Tigers '' . After Wheat 's command was thrown back , and Wheat seriously wounded , Evans received reinforcement from two other brigades under Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and Col. Francis S. Bartow , bringing the force on the flank to 2,800 men . They successfully slowed Hunter 's lead brigade ( Brig. Gen. Ambrose Burnside ) in its attempts to ford Bull Run and advance across Young 's Branch , at the northern end of Henry House Hill . One of Tyler 's brigade commanders , Col. William Tecumseh Sherman , crossed at an unguarded ford and struck the right flank of the Confederate defenders . This surprise attack , coupled with pressure from Burnside and Maj . George Sykes , collapsed the Confederate line shortly after 11 : 30 a.m. , sending them in a disorderly retreat to Henry House Hill . ( Further map details , see : Additional Map 4 , Additional Map 5 , Additional Map 6 and Additional Map 7 . ) Noon phase ( edit ) Henry House Hill ( edit ) As they retreated from their Matthews Hill position , the remainder of Evans 's , Bee 's , and Bartow 's commands received some cover from Capt . John D. Imboden and his battery of four 6 - pounder guns , who held off the Union advance while the Confederates attempted to regroup on Henry House Hill . They were met by generals Johnston and Beauregard , who had just arrived from Johnston 's headquarters at the M. Lewis Farm , `` Portici '' . Fortunately for the Confederates , McDowell did not press his advantage and attempt to seize the strategic ground immediately , choosing to bombard the hill with the batteries of Capts . James B. Ricketts ( Battery I , 1st U.S. Artillery ) and Charles Griffin ( Battery D , 5th U.S. ) from Dogan 's Ridge . Attacks on Henry House Hill , noon -- 2 p.m Union retreat , after 4 p.m. Brig. Gen Thomas J. Jackson 's Virginia Brigade came up in support of the disorganized Confederates around noon , accompanied by Col. Wade Hampton and his Hampton 's Legion , and Col. J.E.B. Stuart 's cavalry . The Hampton Legion , some 600 men strong , managed to buy Jackson time to construct a defensive line on Henry House Hill by firing repeated volleys at Sherman 's advancing brigade . Hampton had purchased about 400 British Enfield rifles to equip the men with , however it is not clear if his troops had them at Bull Run or if the weapons arrived after the battle . If so , they would have been the only foreign - made weapons on the field . The 79th New York was thoroughly decimated by Hampton 's musket fire and began to disintegrate . Wade Hampton gestured towards their colonel , James Cameron , and remarked `` Look at that brave officer trying to lead his men and they wo n't follow him . '' Shortly afterwards , Cameron , the brother of US Senator Simon Cameron , was fatally wounded . It has been claimed that Hampton deliberately targeted officers of the 79th New York in revenge for the death of his nephew earlier in the day , although he had in fact been killed by soldiers of the 69th New York . Jackson posted his five regiments on the reverse slope of the hill , where they were shielded from direct fire , and was able to assemble 13 guns for the defensive line , which he posted on the crest of the hill ; as the guns fired , their recoil moved them down the reverse slope , where they could be safely reloaded . Meanwhile , McDowell ordered the batteries of Ricketts and Griffin to move from Dogan 's Ridge to the hill for close infantry support . Their 11 guns engaged in a fierce artillery duel across 300 yards ( 270 m ) against Jackson 's 13 . Unlike many engagements in the Civil War , here the Confederate artillery had an advantage . The Union pieces were now within range of the Confederate smoothbores and the predominantly rifled pieces on the Union side were not effective weapons at such close ranges , with many shots fired over the head of their targets . Ruins of Judith Henry 's house , `` Spring Hill '' , after the battle Postwar house on site of Judith Henry house in Manassas Judith Henry grave One of the casualties of the artillery fire was Judith Carter Henry , an 85 - year - old widow and invalid , who was unable to leave her bedroom in the Henry House . As Ricketts began receiving rifle fire , he concluded that it was coming from the Henry House and turned his guns on the building . A shell that crashed through the bedroom wall tore off one of the widow 's feet and inflicted multiple injuries , from which she died later that day . `` The Enemy are driving us '' , Bee exclaimed to Jackson . Jackson , a former U.S. Army officer and professor at the Virginia Military Institute , is said to have replied , `` Then , Sir , we will give them the bayonet . '' Bee exhorted his own troops to re-form by shouting , `` There is Jackson standing like a stone wall . Let us determine to die here , and we will conquer . Rally behind the Virginians . '' This exclamation was the source for Jackson 's ( and his brigade 's ) nickname , `` Stonewall '' . Bee was shot through the stomach shortly after speaking and died the next day , thus it is unclear exactly what he meant , moreover none of his subordinates wrote reports of the battle . Col. States Rights Gist , serving as Bee 's aide - de-camp , took command of the brigade . Major Burnett Rhett , chief of staff to General Johnston , claimed that Bee was angry at Jackson 's failure to come immediately to the relief of Bee 's and Bartow 's brigades while they were under heavy pressure . Those who subscribe to this opinion believe that Bee 's statement was meant to be pejorative : `` Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall ! '' Artillery commander Griffin decided to move two of his guns to the southern end of his line , hoping to provide enfilade fire against the Confederates . At approximately 3 p.m. , these guns were overrun by the 33rd Virginia , whose men were outfitted in blue uniforms , causing Griffin 's commander , Maj . William F. Barry , to mistake them for Union troops and to order Griffin not to fire on them . Close range volleys from the 33rd Virginia and Stuart 's cavalry attack against the flank of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment ( Ellsworth 's Fire Zouaves ) , which was supporting the battery , killed many of the gunners and scattered the infantry . Capitalizing on this success , Jackson ordered two regiments to charge Ricketts 's guns and they were captured as well . As additional Federal infantry engaged , the guns changed hands several times . Capture of Ricketts ' Battery , painting by Sidney E. King , National Park Service The capture of the Union guns turned the tide of battle . Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill , outnumbering the Confederates two to one , no more than two were ever engaged simultaneously . Jackson continued to press his attacks , telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry , `` Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards ! Then fire and give them the bayonet ! And when you charge , yell like furies ! '' For the first time , Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell . At about 4 p.m. , the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke 's brigade . To the west , Chinn Ridge had been occupied by Col. Oliver Otis Howard 's brigade from Heintzelman 's division . Also at 4 p.m. , two Confederate brigades - Col. Jubal Early 's , which had moved from the Confederate right , and Brig. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith 's ( commanded by Col. Arnold Elzey after Smith was wounded ) , which had just arrived from the Shenandoah Valley -- crushed Howard 's brigade . Beauregard ordered his entire line forward . At 5 p.m. everywhere McDowell 's army was disintegrating . Thousands , in large and small groups or as individuals , began to leave the battlefield and head for Centreville . McDowell rode around the field trying to rally regiments and groups of soldiers , but most had had enough . Unable to stop the mass exodus , McDowell gave orders for Porter 's regular infantry battalion , near the intersection of the turnpike and Manassas - Sudley Road , to act as a rear guard as his army withdrew . The unit briefly held the crossroads , then retreated eastward with the rest of the army . McDowell 's force crumbled and began to retreat . ( Further map details , see : Additional Map 8 , Additional Map 9 , Additional Map 10 , Additional Map 11 and Additional Map 12 . ) Union retreat ( edit ) The retreat was relatively orderly up to the Bull Run crossings , but it was poorly managed by the Union officers . A Union wagon was overturned by artillery fire on a bridge spanning Cub Run Creek and incited panic in McDowell 's force . As the soldiers streamed uncontrollably toward Centreville , discarding their arms and equipment , McDowell ordered Col. Dixon S. Miles 's division to act as a rear guard , but it was impossible to rally the army short of Washington . In the disorder that followed , hundreds of Union troops were taken prisoner . Wagons and artillery were abandoned , including the 30 - pounder Parrott rifle , which had opened the battle with such fanfare . Expecting an easy Union victory , the wealthy elite of nearby Washington , including congressmen and their families , had come to picnic and watch the battle . When the Union army was driven back in a running disorder , the roads back to Washington were blocked by panicked civilians attempting to flee in their carriages . Since their combined army had been left highly disorganized as well , Beauregard and Johnston did not fully press their advantage , despite urging from Confederate President Jefferson Davis , who had arrived on the battlefield to see the Union soldiers retreating . An attempt by Johnston to intercept the Union troops from his right flank , using the brigades of Brig . Gens . Milledge L. Bonham and James Longstreet , was a failure . The two commanders squabbled with each other and when Bonham 's men received some artillery fire from the Union rear guard , and found that Richardson 's brigade blocked the road to Centreville , he called off the pursuit . In Washington President Lincoln and members of the cabinet waited for news of a Union victory . Instead , a telegram arrived stating `` General McDowell 's army in full retreat through Centreville . The day is lost . Save Washington and the remnants of this army . '' The tidings were happier in the Confederate capital . From the battlefield President Davis telegraphed Richmond , `` We have won a glorious but dear - bought victory . Night closed on the enemy in full flight and closely pursued . '' Aftermath ( edit ) Brief observations ( edit ) First Bull Run was a clash between relatively large , ill - trained bodies of recruits , led by inexperienced officers . Neither army commander was able to deploy his forces effectively ; although nearly 60,000 men were present at the battle , only 18,000 had actually been engaged . Although McDowell had been active on the battlefield , he had expended most of his energy maneuvering nearby regiments and brigades , instead of controlling and coordinating the movements of his army as a whole . Other factors contributed to McDowell 's defeat : Patterson 's failure to hold Johnston in the valley ; McDowell 's two - day delay at Centreville ; allowing Tyler 's division to lead the march on 21 July thus delaying the flanking divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman ; and the 2 1 \/ 2 - hour delay after the Union victory on Matthews ' Hill , which allowed the Confederates to bring up reinforcements and establish a defensive position on Henry Hill . On Henry Hill Beauregard had also limited his control to the regimental level , generally allowing the battle to continue on its own and only reacting to Union moves . Johnston 's decision to transport his infantry to the battlefield by rail played a major role in the Confederate victory . Although the trains were slow and a lack of sufficient cars did not allow the transport of large numbers of troops at one time , almost all of his army arrived in time to participate in the battle . After reaching Manassas Junction , Johnston had relinquished command of the battlefield to Beauregard , but his forwarding of reinforcements to the scene of fighting was decisive . Jackson and Bee 's brigades had done the largest share of fighting in the battle ; Jackson 's brigade had fought almost alone for four hours and sustained over 50 % casualties . Detailed casualties ( edit ) Bull Run was the largest and bloodiest battle in United States history up to that point . Union casualties were 460 killed , 1,124 wounded , and 1,312 missing or captured ; Confederate casualties were 387 killed , 1,582 wounded , and 13 missing . Among the Union dead was Col. James Cameron , brother of President Lincoln 's first Secretary of War , Simon Cameron . Among the Confederate casualties was Col. Francis S. Bartow , who was the first Confederate brigade commander to be killed in the Civil War . General Bee was mortally wounded and died the following day . Compared to later battles , casualties at First Bull Run had not been especially heavy . Both Union and Confederate killed , wounded , and missing were a little over one thousand seven hundred each . Two Confederate brigade commanders , Jackson and Edmund Kirby - Smith , were wounded in the battle . No Union officers above the regimental level were killed ; two division commanders ( Samuel Heintzelman and David Hunter ) , and one brigade commander ( Orlando Willcox ) were wounded .

We are utterly and disgracefully routed , beaten , whipped by secessionists . -- Union diarist George Templeton Strong If the war had turned out to be of short duration , Bull Run would have been a disaster for the Union . But if , as now seemed more plausible , a long and nasty war was inevitable , that battle had a curiously salutary effect for the Union side . It provided a wake - up call for those optimists -- like Seward or even Lincoln -- who had hoped for or counted on a quick result . -- David Detzer , Donnybrook Bull Run was a turning point in the American Civil War ... in the sense that the battle struck with impelling force upon public opinion at home and abroad , upon Congress , and upon the Commander - in - chief . It framed new patterns of thought and led to far - reaching changes in the conduct of the war . The failure at Bull Run inspired a second Northern rising . Volunteering accelerated , 90 - day men reenlisted , states rushed fresh regiments forward in plenitude ... As they realized victory would not come readily , a new mood fastened upon Northerners . An iron resolve entered the Northern soul ... -- James A. Rawley , Turning Points of the Civil War Effect on the Union and subsequent events ( edit ) Union forces and civilians alike feared that Confederate forces would advance on Washington , D.C. , with very little standing in their way . On July 24 , Prof. Thaddeus S.C. Lowe ascended in the balloon Enterprise to observe the Confederates moving in and about Manassas Junction and Fairfax . He saw no evidence of massing Confederate forces , but was forced to land in Confederate territory . It was overnight before he was rescued and could report to headquarters . He reported that his observations `` restored confidence '' to the Union commanders . The Northern public was shocked at the unexpected defeat of their army when an easy victory had been widely anticipated . Both sides quickly came to realize the war would be longer and more brutal than they had imagined . On July 22 President Lincoln signed a bill that provided for the enlistment of another 500,000 men for up to three years of service . On July 25 , eleven thousand Pennsylvanians who had earlier been rejected by the U.S. Secretary of War , Simon Cameron , for federal service in either Patterson 's or McDowell 's command arrived in Washington , D.C. , and were finally accepted . Three months after First Bull Run Union forces suffered another , smaller defeat at the Battle of Ball 's Bluff , near Leesburg , Virginia . The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball 's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War , a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs . Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run , the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell 's army . Although the committee 's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson 's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard , Patterson 's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle , and he was no longer in the service . The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat , and McDowell bore the chief blame . On 25 July 1861 , he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who would soon be named general - in - chief of all the Union armies . McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen. John Pope 's Army of Virginia by Gen. Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia thirteen months later , at the Second Battle of Bull Run . Effect on the Confederacy ( edit ) The reaction in the Confederacy was more muted . There was little public celebration as the Southerners realized that despite their victory , the greater battles that would inevitably come would mean greater losses for their side as well . Once the euphoria of victory had worn off , Jefferson Davis called for 400,000 additional volunteers . Beauregard was considered the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by C.S. President Davis to full general in the Confederate army . Stonewall Jackson , arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory , received no special recognition , but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign . Privately , Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory . Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow : `` Our President and our General direct me to thank you . We rely upon you for further information . The Confederacy owes you a debt . ( Signed ) JORDAN , Adjutant - General . '' The battle also had long - term psychological consequences . The decisive victory led to a degree of over-confidence on the part of Confederate forces , while prompting a determined organizational effort on the part of the Union . In hindsight commentators on both sides agreed that the one - sided outcome `` proved the greatest misfortune that would have befallen the Confederacy '' . Although modern historians generally agree with this interpretation , James M. McPherson has argued that the esprit de corps attained by Confederate troops on the heels of their victory , together with a new sense of insecurity felt by northern commanders , also gave the Confederacy a military edge in the following months . Confederate victory : turning point of the American Civil War ( edit ) Further information : Turning point of the American Civil War \u00a7 Confederate victory in First Battle of Bull Run ( July 1861 ) `` Bull Run '' vs. `` Manassas '' ( edit ) The name of the battle has caused controversy since 1861 . The Union Army frequently named battles after significant rivers and creeks that played a role in the fighting ; the Confederates generally used the names of nearby towns or farms . The U.S. National Park Service uses the Confederate name for its national battlefield park , but the Union name ( Bull Run ) also has widespread currency in popular literature . Confusion between the battle flags ( edit ) Battlefield confusion between the battle flags , especially the similarity of the Confederacy 's `` Stars and Bars '' and the Union 's `` Stars and Stripes '' when fluttering , led to the adoption of the Confederate Battle Flag , which eventually became the most popular symbol of the Confederacy and the South in general . Conclusions ( edit ) First Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be won by one grand battle , and both sides began preparing for a long and bloody conflict . The battle also showed the need for adequately trained and experienced officers and men . One year later many of the same soldiers who had fought at First Bull Run , now combat veterans , would have an opportunity to test their skills on the same battlefield at the Second Battle of Bull Run \/ Manassas .

{"document_plaintext":"Command - line interface - wikipedia Command - line interface Not to be confused with Text - based user interface . Screenshot of a sample bash session in GNOME Terminal 3 , Fedora 15 Screenshot of Windows PowerShell 1.0 , running on Windows Vista A command - line interface or command language interpreter ( CLI ) , also known as command - line user interface , console user interface and character user interface ( CUI ) , is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user ( or client ) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text ( command lines ) . A program which handles the interface is called a command language interpreter or shell ( computing ) . The CLI was the primary means of interaction with most computer systems on computer terminals in the mid-1960s , and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on OpenVMS , Unix systems and personal computer systems including MS - DOS , CP \/ M and Apple DOS . The interface is usually implemented with a command line shell , which is a program that accepts commands as text input and converts commands into appropriate operating system functions . Today , many end users rarely , if ever , use command - line interfaces and instead rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu - driven interactions . However , many software developers , system administrators and advanced users still rely heavily on command - line interfaces to perform tasks more efficiently , configure their machine , or access programs and program features that are not available through a graphical interface . Alternatives to the command line include , but are not limited to text user interface menus ( see IBM AIX SMIT for example ) , keyboard shortcuts , and various other desktop metaphors centered on the pointer ( usually controlled with a mouse ) . Examples of this include the Windows versions 1 , 2 , 3 , 3.1 , and 3.11 ( an OS shell that runs in DOS ) , DosShell , and Mouse Systems PowerPanel . Programs with command - line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting . Command - line interfaces for software other than operating systems include a number of programming languages such as Tcl \/ Tk , PHP , and others , as well as utilities such as the compression utility WinZip , and some FTP and SSH \/ Telnet clients .

Since options to commands are given in a few characters in each command line , an experienced user finds the options easier to access . Automation of repetitive tasks is simplified - most operating systems using a command line interface support some mechanism for storing frequently used sequences in a disk file , for re-use ; this may extend to a scripting language that can take parameters and variable options . A command - line history can be kept , allowing review or repetition of commands . A command - line system may require paper or online manuals for the user 's reference , although often a `` help '' option provides a concise review of the options of a command . The command - line environment may not provide the graphical enhancements such as different fonts or extended edit windows found in a GUI . It may be difficult for a new user to become familiar with all the commands and options available , compared with the drop - down menus of a graphical user interface , without repeated reference to manuals . Operating system command - line interfaces ( edit ) Operating system ( OS ) command line interfaces are usually distinct programs supplied with the operating system . A program that implements such a text interface is often called a command - line interpreter , command processor or shell . Examples of command - line interpreters include DEC 's DIGITAL Command Language ( DCL ) in OpenVMS and RSX - 11 , the various Unix shells ( sh , ksh , csh , tcsh , bash , etc . ) , CP \/ M 's CCP , DOS 's COMMAND.COM , as well as the OS \/ 2 and the Windows CMD. EXE programs , the latter groups being based heavily on DEC 's RSX - 11 and RSTS CLIs . Under most operating systems , it is possible to replace the default shell program with alternatives ; examples include 4DOS for DOS , 4OS2 for OS \/ 2 , and 4NT or Take Command for Windows . Although the term ' shell ' is often used to describe a command - line interpreter , strictly speaking a ' shell ' can be any program that constitutes the user - interface , including fully graphically oriented ones . For example , the default Windows GUI is a shell program named EXPLORER. EXE , as defined in the SHELL = EXPLORER. EXE line in the WIN. INI configuration file . These programs are shells , but not CLIs . Application command - line interfaces ( edit ) Application programs ( as opposed to operating systems ) may also have command line interfaces . An application program may support none , any , or all of these three major types of command line interface mechanisms : Parameters : Most operating systems support a means to pass additional information to a program when it is launched . When a program is launched from an OS command line shell , additional text provided along with the program name is passed to the launched program . Interactive command line sessions : After launch , a program may provide an operator with an independent means to enter commands in the form of text . OS inter-process communication : Most operating systems support means of inter-process communication ( for example ; standard streams or named pipes ) . Command lines from client processes may be redirected to a CLI program by one of these methods . Some applications support only a CLI , presenting a CLI prompt to the user and acting upon command lines as they are entered . Other programs support both a CLI and a GUI . In some cases , a GUI is simply a wrapper around a separate CLI executable file . In other cases , a program may provide a CLI as an optional alternative to its GUI . CLIs and GUIs often support different functionality . For example , all features of MATLAB , a numerical analysis computer program , are available via the CLI , whereas the MATLAB GUI exposes only a subset of features . The early Sierra games , like the first three King 's Quest games ( 1984 -- 1986 ) , used commands from an internal command line to move the character around in the graphic window . History ( edit ) The command - line interface evolved from a form of dialog once conducted by humans over teleprinter ( TTY ) machines , in which human operators remotely exchanged information , usually one line of text at a time . Early computer systems often used teleprinter machines as the means of interaction with a human operator . The computer became one end of the human - to - human teleprinter model . So instead of a human communicating with another human over a teleprinter , a human communicated with a computer . The mechanical teleprinter was replaced by a `` glass tty '' , a keyboard and screen emulating the teleprinter . `` Smart '' terminals permitted additional functions , such as cursor movement over the entire screen , or local editing of data on the terminal for transmission to the computer . As the microcomputer revolution replaced the traditional -- minicomputer + terminals -- time sharing architecture , hardware terminals were replaced by terminal emulators -- PC software that interpreted terminal signals sent through the PC 's serial ports . These were typically used to interface an organization 's new PC 's with their existing mini - or mainframe computers , or to connect PC to PC . Some of these PCs were running Bulletin Board System software . Early operating system CLIs were implemented as part of resident monitor programs , and could not easily be replaced . The first implementation of the shell as a replaceable component was part of the Multics time - sharing operating system . In 1964 , MIT Computation Center staff member Louis Pouzin developed the RUNCOM tool for executing command scripts while allowing argument substitution . Pouzin coined the term `` shell '' to describe the technique of using commands like a programming language , and wrote a paper about how to implement the idea in the Multics operating system . Pouzin returned to his native France in 1965 , and the first Multics shell was developed by Glenda Schroeder . The first Unix shell , the V6 shell , was developed by Ken Thompson in 1971 at Bell Labs and was modeled after Schroeder 's Multics shell . The Bourne shell was introduced in 1977 as a replacement for the V6 shell . Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter , it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs . The Bourne shell led to the development of the Korn shell ( ksh ) , Almquist shell ( ash ) , and the popular Bourne - again shell ( or Bash ) . Early microcomputers themselves were based on a command - line interface such as CP \/ M , DOS or AppleSoft BASIC . During the 1980s and 1990s , the introduction of the Apple Macintosh and of Microsoft Windows on PCs saw the command line interface as the primary user interface replaced by the Graphical User Interface . The command line remained available as an alternative user interface , often used by system administrators and other advanced users for system administration , computer programming and batch processing . In November 2006 , Microsoft released version 1.0 of Windows PowerShell ( formerly codenamed Monad ) , which combined features of traditional Unix shells with their proprietary object - oriented . NET Framework . MinGW and Cygwin are open - source packages for Windows that offer a Unix - like CLI . Microsoft provides MKS Inc. 's ksh implementation MKS Korn shell for Windows through their Services for UNIX add - on . Since 2001 , the Macintosh operating system is based on a variation of Unix called Darwin . On these computers , users can access a Unix - like command - line interface called Terminal found in the Applications Utilities folder . This terminal uses bash by default .

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( April 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) A CLI is used whenever a large vocabulary of commands or queries , coupled with a wide ( or arbitrary ) range of options , can be entered more rapidly as text than with a pure GUI . This is typically the case with operating system command shells . CLIs are also used by systems with insufficient resources to support a graphical user interface . Some computer language systems ( such as Python , Forth , LISP , Rexx , and many dialects of BASIC ) provide an interactive command - line mode to allow for rapid evaluation of code . CLIs are often used by programmers and system administrators , in engineering and scientific environments , and by technically advanced personal computer users . CLIs are also popular among people with visual disability , since the commands and responses can be displayed using Refreshable Braille displays . Anatomy of a shell CLI ( edit ) This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( July 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The general pattern of an OS command line interface is : Prompt command param1 param2 param3 ... paramN Prompt - generated by the program to provide context for the client . Command -- provided by the client . Commands are usually one of three classes : Internal -- recognized and processed by the command line interpreter itself and not dependent upon any external executable file . Included -- A separate executable file generally considered part of the operating environment and always included with the OS . External -- External executable files not part of the basic OS , but added by other parties for specific purposes and applications . param1 ... paramN -- Optional parameters provided by the client . The format and meaning of the parameters depends upon the command issued . In the case of Included or External commands , the values of the parameters are delivered to the program ( specified by the Command ) as it is launched by the OS . Parameters may be either Arguments or Options . In this example , the delimiters between command line elements are whitespace characters and the end - of - line delimiter is the newline delimiter . This is a widely used ( but not universal ) convention for command - line interfaces . A CLI can generally be considered as consisting of syntax and semantics . The syntax is the grammar that all commands must follow . In the case of operating systems , DOS and Unix each define their own set of rules that all commands must follow . In the case of embedded systems , each vendor , such as Nortel , Juniper Networks or Cisco Systems , defines their own proprietary set of rules that all commands within their CLI conform to . These rules also dictate how a user navigates through the system of commands . The semantics define what sort of operations are possible , on what sort of data these operations can be performed , and how the grammar represents these operations and data -- the symbolic meaning in the syntax . Two different CLIs may agree on either syntax or semantics , but it is only when they agree on both that they can be considered sufficiently similar to allow users to use both CLIs without needing to learn anything , as well as to enable re-use of scripts . A simple CLI will display a prompt , accept a `` command line '' typed by the user terminated by the Enter key , then execute the specified command and provide textual display of results or error messages . Advanced CLIs will validate , interpret and parameter - expand the command line before executing the specified command , and optionally capture or redirect its output . Unlike a button or menu item in a GUI , a command line is typically self - documenting , stating exactly what the user wants done . In addition , command lines usually include many defaults that can be changed to customize the results . Useful command lines can be saved by assigning a character string or alias to represent the full command , or several commands can be grouped to perform a more complex sequence -- for instance , compile the program , install it , and run it -- creating a single entity , called a command procedure or script which itself can be treated as a command . These advantages mean that a user must figure out a complex command or series of commands only once , because they can be saved , to be used again . The commands given to a CLI shell are often in one of the following forms : doSomething how toFiles doSomething how sourceFile destinationFile doSomething how < inputFile > outputFile doSomething how doSomething how doSomething how > outputFile where doSomething is , in effect , a verb , how an adverb ( for example , should the command be executed `` verbosely '' or `` quietly '' ) and toFiles an object or objects ( typically one or more files ) on which the command should act . The > in the third example is a redirection operator , telling the command - line interpreter to send the output of the command not to its own standard output ( the screen ) but to the named file . This will overwrite the file . Using > > will redirect the output and append it to the file . Another redirection operator is the vertical bar ( ) , which creates a pipeline where the output of one command becomes the input to the next command . CLI and Resource protection ( edit ) One can modify the set of available commands by modifying which paths appear in the PATH environment variable . Under Unix , commands also need be marked as executable files . The directories in the path variable are searched in the order they are given . By re-ordering the path , one can run e.g. \\ OS2 \\ MDOS \\ E. EXE instead of \\ OS2 \\ E. EXE , when the default is the opposite . Renaming of the executables also works : people often rename their favourite editor to EDIT , for example . The command line allows one to restrict available commands , such as access to advanced internal commands . The Windows CMD. EXE does this . Often , shareware programs will limit the range of commands , including printing a command ' your administrator has disabled running batch files ' from the prompt . Some CLIs , such as those in network routers , have a hierarchy of modes , with a different set of commands supported in each mode . The set of commands are grouped by association with security , system , interface , etc . In these systems the user might traverse through a series of sub-modes . For example , if the CLI had two modes called interface and system , the user might use the command interface to enter the interface mode . At this point , commands from the system mode may not be accessible and the user exits the interface mode and enters the system mode . Command prompt ( edit ) `` Command prompt '' redirects here . For the Windows component named Command Prompt , see cmd. exe . A command prompt ( or just prompt ) is a sequence of ( one or more ) characters used in a command - line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands . It literally prompts the user to take action . A prompt usually ends with one of the characters $ , % , # , : , > and often includes other information , such as the path of the current working directory and the hostname . On many Unix and derivative systems , the prompt commonly ends in $ or % if the user is a normal user , but in # if the user is a superuser ( `` root '' in Unix terminology ) . End - users can often modify prompts . Depending on the environment , they may include colors , special characters , and other elements ( like variables and functions for the current time , user , shell number or working directory ) in order , for instance , to make the prompt more informative or visually pleasing , to distinguish sessions on various machines , or to indicate the current level of nesting of commands . On some systems , special tokens in the definition of the prompt can be used to cause external programs to be called by the command - line interpreter while displaying the prompt . In DOS 's COMMAND.COM and in Windows NT 's cmd. exe users can modify the prompt by issuing a PROMPT command or by directly changing the value of the corresponding % PROMPT % environment variable . The default of most modern systems , the C : \\ > style is obtained , for instance , with PROMPT $ P $ G . The default of older DOS systems , C > is obtained by just PROMPT , although on some systems this produces the newer C : \\ > style , unless used on floppy drives A : or B : ; on those systems PROMPT $ N $ G can be used to override the automatic default and explicitly switch to the older style . Many Unix systems feature the $ PS1 variable ( Prompt String 1 ) , although other variables also may affect the prompt ( depending on the shell used ) . In the bash shell , a prompt of the form : ( time ) user@host : work_dir $ could be set by issuing the command export PS1 = ' ( \\ t ) \\ u @ \\ H : \\ W $ ' In zsh the $ RPROMPT variable controls an optional `` prompt '' on the right - hand side of the display . It is not a real prompt in that the location of text entry does not change . It is used to display information on the same line as the prompt , but right - justified . In RISC OS the command prompt is a * symbol , and thus ( OS ) CLI commands are often referred to as `` star commands '' . One can also access the same commands from other command lines ( such as the BBC BASIC command line ) , by preceding the command with a * . Arguments ( edit ) An MS DOS command line , illustrating parsing into command and arguments A command - line argument or parameter is an item of information provided to a program when it is started . A program can have many command - line arguments that identify sources or destinations of information , or that alter the operation of the program . When a command processor is active a program is typically invoked by typing its name followed by command - line arguments ( if any ) . For example , in Unix and Unix - like environments , an example of a command - line argument is : rm file. s `` file. s '' is a command - line argument which tells the program rm to remove the file `` file. s '' . Some programming languages , such as C , C++ and Java , allow a program to interpret the command - line arguments by handling them as string parameters in the main function . Other languages , such as Python , expose these arguments as global variables . In Unix - like operating systems , a single hyphen - minus by itself is usually a special value specifying that a program should handle data coming from the standard input or send data to the standard output . Command - line option ( edit ) A command - line option or simply option ( also known as a flag or switch ) modifies the operation of a command ; the effect is determined by the command 's program . Options follow the command name on the command line , separated by spaces . A space before the first option is not always required , for example Dir \/ ? and DIR \/ ? have the same effect in DOS ( list the DIR command 's options ) whereas dir -- help ( in many versions of Unix ) does require the option to be preceded by at least one space ( and is case - sensitive ) . The format of options varies widely between operating systems . In most cases the syntax is by convention rather than an operating system requirement ; the entire command line is simply a string passed to a program , which can process it in any way the programmer wants , so long as the interpreter can tell where the command name ends and its arguments and options begin . A few representative samples of command - line options , all relating to listing files in a directory , to illustrate some conventions : Operating system Command Valid alternative Notes OpenVMS directory \/ owner Dir \/ Owner instruct the directory command to also display the ownership of the files . Note the Directory command name is not case sensitive , and can be abbreviated to as few letters as required to remain unique . DOS dir \/ Q \/ O :S d * diR \/ qd * \/ o :s display ownership of files whose names begin with `` D '' , sorted by size , smallest first . Note spaces around argument d * are required . Unix - like systems ls - lS D * ls - S - l D * display in long format files and directories beginning with `` D '' ( but not `` d '' ) , sorted by size ( largest first ) . Note spaces are required around all arguments and options , but some can be run together , e.g. - lS is the same as - l - S . Data General RDOS CLI list \/ e \/ s 04 - 26 - 80 \/ b List \/ S \/ E 4 - 26 - 80 \/ B list every attribute for files created before 26 April 1980 . Note the \/ B at the end of the date argument is a local switch , that modifies the meaning of that argument , while \/ S and \/ E are global switches , i.e. apply to the whole command . Abbreviating commands ( edit ) In Multics , command - line options and subsystem keywords may be abbreviated . This idea appears to derive from the PL \/ I programming language , with its shortened keywords ( e.g. , STRG for STRINGRANGE and DCL for DECLARE ) . For example , in the Multics `` forum '' subsystem , the - long_subject parameter can be abbreviated - lgsj . It is also common for Multics commands to be abbreviated , typically corresponding to the initial letters of the words that are strung together with underscores to form command names , such as the use of did for delete_iacl_dir . In some other systems abbreviations are automatic , such as permitting enough of the first characters of a command name to uniquely identify it ( such as SU as an abbreviation for SUPERUSER ) while others may have some specific abbreviations pre-programmed ( e.g. MD for MKDIR in COMMAND.COM ) or user - defined via batch scripts and aliases ( e.g. alias md mkdir in tcsh ) . See also : Tab completion . Option Conventions in DOS , Windows , OS \/ 2 ( edit ) On DOS , OS \/ 2 and Windows , different programs called from their COMMAND.COM or CMD. EXE ( or internal their commands ) may use different syntax within the same operating system . For example : Options may be indicated by either of the `` switch characters '' : - , \/ , or either may be allowed . See below . They may or may not be case - sensitive . Sometimes options and their arguments are run together , sometimes separated by whitespace , and sometimes by a character , typically : or = ; thus Prog - fFilename , Prog - f Filename , Prog - f : Filename , Prog - f = Filename . Some programs allow single - character options to be combined ; others do not . The switch - fA may mean the same as - f - A , or it may be incorrect , or it may even be a valid but different parameter . In DOS , OS \/ 2 and Windows , the forward slash ( \/ ) is most prevalent , although the hyphen - minus is also sometimes used . In many versions of DOS ( MS - DOS \/ PC DOS 2. xx and higher , all versions of DR - DOS since 5.0 , as well as PTS - DOS , Embedded DOS , FreeDOS and RxDOS ) the switch character ( sometimes abbreviated switchar or switchchar ) to be used is defined by a value returned from a system call ( INT 21h \/ AH = 37h ) . The default character returned by this API is \/ , but can be changed to a hyphen - minus on the above - mentioned systems , except for under Datalight ROM - DOS and MS - DOS \/ PC DOS 5.0 and higher , which always return \/ from this call ( unless one of many available TSRs to reenable the SwitChar feature is loaded ) . In some of these systems ( MS - DOS \/ PC DOS 2. xx , DOS Plus 2.1 , DR - DOS 7.02 and higher , PTS - DOS , Embedded DOS , FreeDOS and RxDOS ) , the setting can also be pre-configured by a SWITCHAR directive in CONFIG. SYS . General Software 's Embedded DOS provides a SWITCH command for the same purpose , whereas 4DOS allows the setting to be changed via SETDOS \/ W : n . Under DR - DOS , if the setting has been changed from \/ , the first directory separator \\ in the display of the PROMPT parameter $ G will change to a forward slash \/ ( which is also a valid directory separator in DOS , FlexOS , 4680 OS , 4690 OS , OS \/ 2 and Windows ) thereby serving as a visual clue to indicate the change . Some versions of DR - DOS COMMAND.COM also support a PROMPT token $ \/ to display the current setting . COMMAND.COM since DR - DOS 7.02 also provides a pseudo-environment variable named % \/ % to allow portable batchjobs to be written . Several external DR - DOS commands additionally support an environment variable % SWITCHAR % to override the system setting . However , many programs are hardwired to use \/ only , rather than retrieving the switch setting before parsing command - line arguments . A very small number , mainly ports from Unix - like systems , are programmed to accept `` - '' even if the switch character is not set to it ( for example netstat and ping , supplied with Windows , will accept the \/ ? option to list available options , and yet the list will specify the `` - '' convention ) . Option Conventions in Unix - like systems ( edit ) This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( April 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In Unix - like systems , the ASCII hyphen - minus begins options ; the new ( and GNU ) convention is to use two hyphens then a word ( e.g. -- create ) to identify the option 's use while the old convention ( and still available as an option for frequently - used options ) is to use one hyphen then one letter ( e.g. , - c ) ; if one hyphen is followed by two or more letters it may mean two options are being specified , or it may mean the second and subsequent letters are a parameter ( such as filename or date ) for the first option . Two hyphen - minus characters without following letters ( -- ) may indicate that the remaining arguments should not be treated as options , which is useful for example if a file name itself begins with a hyphen , or if further arguments are meant for an inner command ( e.g. , sudo ) . Double hyphen - minuses are also sometimes used to prefix `` long options '' where more descriptive option names are used . This is a common feature of GNU software . The getopt function and program , and the getopts command are usually used for parsing command - line options . Unix command names , arguments and options are case - sensitive ( except in a few examples , mainly where popular commands from other operating systems have been ported to Unix ) . Options Conventions in other systems ( edit ) FlexOS , 4680 OS and 4690 OS use - . CP \/ M typically used ( . Conversational Monitor System ( CMS ) uses a single left parenthesis to separate options at the end of the command from the other arguments . For example , in the following command the options indicate that the target file should be replaced if it exists , and the date and time of the source file should be retained on the copy : COPY source file a target file b ( REPLACE OLDDATE Data General 's CLI under their RDOS , AOS , etc. operating systems , as well as the version of CLI that came with their Business Basic , uses only \/ as the switch character , is case - insensitive , and allows `` local switches '' on some arguments to control the way they are interpreted , such as MAC \/ U LIB \/ SABC $ LPT \/ L has the global option `` U '' to the macro assembler command to appemd user symbols , but two local switches , one to specify LIB should be skipped on pass 2 and the other to direct listing to the printer , $ LPT . Built - in usage help ( edit ) See also : help ( command ) One of the criticisms of a CLI is the lack of cues to the user as to the available actions . In contrast , GUIs usually inform the user of available actions with menus , icons , or other visual cues . To overcome this limitation , many CLI programs display a brief summary of its valid parameters , typically when invoked with no arguments or one of ? , - ? , - h , - H , \/ ? , \/ h , \/ H , - help , or -- help . However , entering a program name without parameters in the hope that it will display usage help can be hazardous , as some programs and scripts execute without further notice . Although desirable at least for the help parameter , programs may not support all option lead - in characters exemplified above . Under DOS , where the default command - line option character can be changed from \/ to - , programs may query the SwitChar API in order to determine the current setting . So , if a program is not hard - wired to support them all , a user may need to know the current setting even to be able to reliably request help . If the SwitChar has been changed to - and therefore the \/ character is accepted as alternative path delimiter also at the DOS command line , programs may misinterpret options like \/ h or \/ H as paths rather than help parameters . However , if given as first or only parameter , most DOS programs will , by convention , accept it as request for help regardless of the current SwitChar setting . In some cases , different levels of help can be selected for a program . Some programs supporting this allow to give a verbosity level as an optional argument to the help parameter ( as in \/ H : 1 , \/ H : 2 , etc . ) or they give just a short help on help parameters with question mark and a longer help screen for the other help options . Depending on the program , additional or more specific help on accepted parameters is sometimes available by either providing the parameter in question as an argument to the help parameter or vice versa ( as in \/ H : W or in \/ W : ? ( assuming \/ W would be another parameter supported by the program ) ) . In a similar fashion to the help parameter , but much less common , some programs provide additional information about themselves ( like mode , status , version , author , license or contact information ) when invoked with an `` about '' parameter like - ! , \/ ! , - about , or -- about . Since the ? and ! characters typically also serve other purposes at the command line , they may not be available in all scenarios , therefore , they should not be the only options to access the corresponding help information . If more detailed help is necessary than provided by a program 's built - in internal help , many systems support a dedicated external `` HELP command '' command ( or similar ) , which accepts a command name as calling parameter and will invoke an external help system . In the DR - DOS family , typing \/ ? or \/ H at the COMMAND.COM prompt instead of a command itself will display a dynamically generated list of available internal commands ; 4DOS and NDOS support the same feature by typing ? at the prompt ( which is also accepted by newer versions of DR - DOS COMMAND.COM ) ; internal commands can be individually disabled or reenabled via SETDOS \/ I . In addition to this , some newer versions of DR - DOS COMMAND.COM also accept a ? % command to display a list of available built - in pseudo-environment variables . Besides their purpose as quick help reference this can be used in batchjobs to query the facilities of the underlying command - line processor . Command description syntax ( edit ) Built - in usage help and man pages commonly employ a small syntax to describe the valid command form : angle brackets for required parameters : ping < hostname > square brackets for optional parameters : mkdir ( - p ) < dirname > ellipses for repeated items : cp < source1 > ( source2 ... ) < dest > vertical bars for choice of items : netstat ( - t - u ) Notice that these characters have different meanings than when used directly in the shell . Angle brackets may be omitted when confusing the parameter name with a literal string is not likely . The space character ( edit ) In many areas of computing , but particularly in the command line , the space character can cause problems as it has two distinct and incompatible functions : as part of a command or parameter , or as a parameter or name separator . Ambiguity can be prevented either by prohibiting embedded spaces in file and directory names in the first place ( for example , by substituting them with underscores _ ) , or by enclosing a name with embedded spaces between quote characters or using an escape character before the space , usually a backslash ( \\ ) . For example Long path \/ Long program name Parameter one Parameter two ... is ambiguous ( is `` program name '' part of the program name , or two parameters ? ) ; however Long_path \/ Long_program_name Parameter_one Parameter_two ... , LongPath \/ LongProgramName ParameterOne ParameterTwo ... , `` Long path \/ Long program name '' `` Parameter one '' `` Parameter two '' ... and Long \\ path \/ Long \\ program \\ name Parameter \\ one Parameter \\ two ... are not ambiguous . Unix - based operating systems minimize the use of embedded spaces to minimize the need for quotes . In Microsoft Windows , one often has to use quotes because embedded spaces ( such as in directory names ) are common . Command - line interpreter ( edit ) See also : List of command - line interpreters Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter , it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command . Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution , it is a strange language , shaped as much by history as by design . -- Brian Kernighan & Rob Pike The terms command - line interpreter ( abbreviated CLI ) , command - line shell , or command language interpreter ( also abbreviated CLI ) are applied to computer programs designed to interpret a sequence of lines of text which may be entered by a user , read from a file or another kind of data stream . The context of interpretation is usually one of a given operating system or programming language . Command - line interpreters allow users to issue various commands in a very efficient ( and often terse ) way . This requires the user to know the names of the commands and their parameters , and the syntax of the language that is interpreted . The Unix # ! mechanism and OS \/ 2 EXTPROC command facilitate the passing of batch files to external processors . One can use these mechanisms to write specific command processors for dedicated uses , and process external data files which reside in batch files . Many graphical interfaces , such as the OS \/ 2 Presentation Manager and early versions of Microsoft Windows use command - lines to call helper programs to open documents and programs . The commands are stored in the graphical shell or in files like the registry or the OS \/ 2 os2user. ini file . Early history ( edit ) The earliest computers did not support interactive input \/ output devices , often relying on sense switches and lights to communicate with the computer operator . This was adequate for batch systems that ran one program at a time , often with the programmer acting as operator . This also had the advantage of low overhead , since lights and switches could be tested and set with one machine instruction . Later a single system console was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system . From the 1960s onwards , user interaction with computers was primarily by means of command - line interfaces , initially on machines like the Teletype Model 33 ASR , but then on early CRT - based computer terminals such as the VT52 . All of these devices were purely text based , with no ability to display graphic or pictures . For business application programs , text - based menus were used , but for more general interaction the command line was the interface . Around 1964 Louis Pouzin introduced the concept and the name shell in Multics , building on earlier , simpler facilities in the Compatible Time - Sharing System ( CTSS ) . From the early 1970s the Unix operating system adapted the concept of a powerful command - line environment , and introduced the ability to pipe the output of one command in as input to another . Unix also had the capability to save and re-run strings of commands as `` shell scripts '' which acted like custom commands . The command - line was also the main interface for the early home computers such as the Commodore PET , Apple II and BBC Micro -- almost always in the form of a BASIC interpreter . When more powerful business oriented microcomputers arrived with CP \/ M and later DOS computers such as the IBM PC , the command - line began to borrow some of the syntax and features of the Unix shells such as globbing and piping of output . The command - line was first seriously challenged by the PARC GUI approach used in the 1983 Apple Lisa and the 1984 Apple Macintosh . A few computer users used GUIs such as GEOS and Windows 3.1 but the majority of IBM PC users did not replace their COMMAND.COM shell with a GUI until Windows 95 was released in 1995 . Modern usage as an operating system shell ( edit ) While most non-expert computer users now use a GUI almost exclusively , more advanced users have access to powerful command - line environments : The default VAX \/ VMS command shell , using the DCL language , has been ported to Windows systems at least three times , including PC - DCL and Acceler8 DCL Lite . Unix command shells have been ported to VMS and DOS \/ Windows 95 and Windows NT types of operating systems . COMMAND.COM and Windows NT cmd. exe have been ported to Windows CE and presumably works on Microsoft Windows NT Embedded 4.0 Windows Resource Kit and Windows Services for Unix include Korn and the Bourne shells along with a Perl interpreter ( Services of Unix contains Active State ActivePerl in later versions and Interix for versions 1 and 2 and a shell compiled by Microsoft ) IBM OS \/ 2 has the cmd. exe processor . This copies the COMMAND.COM commands , with extensions to REXX . cmd. exe and COMMAND.COM are part of the Windows NT stream of operating systems . Yet another cmd. exe is a stripped - down shell for Windows CE 3.0 . An MS - DOS type interpreter called PocketDOS has been ported to Windows CE machines ; the most recent release is almost identical to MS - DOS 6.22 and can also run Windows 1 , 2 , and 3.0 , QBasic and other development tools , 4NT and 4DOS . The latest release includes several shells , namely MS - DOS 6.22 , PC DOS 7 , DR DOS 3. xx , and others PocketConsole is a Windows NT 4.0 shell for Windows CE that is much like 4NT . Windows users have a CLI environment named Windows Command Prompt , which might use the CScript interface to alternate programs . PowerShell provides a command - line interface , but its applets are not written in Shell script . Implementations of the Unix shell are also available as part of the POSIX sub-system , Cygwin , MKS Toolkit , UWIN , Hamilton C shell and other software packages . Available shells for these interoperability tools include csh , ksh , sh , bash , rsh , tclsh and less commonly zsh , ysh , psh COMMAND.COM ( 4DOS ) , Windows NT cmd. exe ( 4NT , TCC ) , and OS \/ 2 cmd. exe ( 4OS2 ) and others based on them are enhanced shells which can be a replacement for the native shell or a means of enhancement of the default shell Implementations of PHP have a shell for interactive use called php - cli . Standard Tcl \/ Tk has two interactive shells , Tclsh and Wish , the latter being the GUI version . Python , Ruby , Lua , XLNT , and other interpreters also have command shells for interactive use . FreeBSD uses tcsh as its default interactive shell for the superuser . Apple macOS and many Linux distributions have the Bash implementation of the Unix shell . Early versions of macOS used tcsh as the default shell . Embedded Linux ( and other embedded Unix - like ) devices often use the Ash implementation of the Unix shell , as part of Busybox . Android uses the mksh shell , which replaces a shell derived from ash that was used in older Android versions , supplemented with commands from the separate toolbox binary . Routers with Cisco IOS , Junos and many others are commonly configured from the command line . Scripting ( edit ) Most command - line interpreters support scripting , to various extents . ( They are , after all , interpreters of an interpreted programming language , albeit in many cases the language is unique to the particular command - line interpreter . ) They will interpret scripts ( variously termed shell scripts or batch files ) written in the language that they interpret . Some command - line interpreters also incorporate the interpreter engines of other languages , such as REXX , in addition to their own , allowing the executing of scripts , in those languages , directly within the command - line interpreter itself . Conversely , scripting programming languages , in particular those with an eval function ( such as REXX , Perl , Python , Ruby or Jython ) , can be used to implement command - line interpreters and filters . For a few operating systems , most notably DOS , such a command interpreter provides a more flexible command - line interface than the one supplied . In other cases , such a command interpreter can present a highly customised user interface employing the user interface and input \/ output facilities of the language . Other command - line interfaces ( edit ) The command line provides an interface between programs as well as the user . In this sense , a command line is an alternative to a dialog box . Editors and databases present a command line , in which alternate command processors might run . On the other hand , one might have options on the command line , which opens a dialog box . The latest version of ' Take Command ' has this feature . DBase used a dialog box to construct command lines , which could be further edited before use . Programs like Basic , Diskpart , Edlin , and QBasic all provide command - line interfaces , some of which use the system shell . Basic is modeled on the default interface for 8 - bit Intel computers . Calculators can be run as command - line or dialog interfaces . Emacs provides a command - line interface in the form of its minibuffer . Commands and arguments can be entered using Emacs standard text editing support , and output is displayed in another buffer . There are a number of text mode games , like Adventure or King 's Quest 1 - 3 , which relied on the user typing commands at the bottom of the screen . One controls the character by typing commands like ' get ring ' or ' look ' . The program returns a text which describes how the character sees it , or makes the action happen . The text adventure The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , a piece of interactive fiction based on Douglas Adam 's book of the same name , is a teletype - style command - line game . The most notable of these interfaces is the standard streams interface , which allows the output of one command to be passed to the input of another . Text files can serve either purpose as well . This provides the interfaces of piping , filters and redirection . Under Unix , devices are files too , so the normal type of file for the shell used for stdin , stdout and stderr is a tty device file . Another command - line interface allows a shell program to launch helper programs , either to launch documents or start a program . The command is processed internally by the shell , and then passed on to another program to launch the document . The graphical interface of Windows and OS \/ 2 rely heavily on command - lines passed through to other programs -- console or graphical , which then usually process the command line without presenting a user - console . Programs like the OS \/ 2 E editor and some other IBM editors , can process command - lines normally meant for the shell , the output being placed directly in the document window . A web browser 's URL input field can be used as a command line . It can be used to `` launch '' web apps , access browser configuration , as well as perform a search . Google , which has been called `` the command line of the internet '' will perform a domain - specific search when it detects search parameters in a known format . This functionality is present whether the search is triggered from a browser field or on Google 's website .

Was the Command Line Natural user interface Notes ( edit ) Jump up ^ An example is the comprehensive internal help system of the DR - DOS 7.03 DEBUG command , which can be invoked via ? ? at the debug prompt ( rather than only the default ? overview ) . Specific help pages can be selected via ? n ( where n is the number of the page ) . Additionally , help for specific commands can be displayed by specifying the command name after ? , f.e. ? D will invoke help for the various dump commands ( like D etc . ) . Some of these features were already supported by the DR DOS 3.41 SID86 and GEMSID .

Notable difference : The Windows Server 2003 R2 documentation uses italic letters for `` Information that the user must supply '' , while the Server 2008 documentation uses angle brackets .

The new research found that the reduction in price levels due to Walmart resulted to savings for consumers of $287 billion in 2006 , equivalent to $957 per person and $2,500 per household . Logo designed in 2008 On June 30 , 2008 , Walmart unveiled the company 's new logo , which stylized the name as `` Walmart '' .

In March 2006 , Walmart sought to appeal to a more affluent demographic , with the opening of a new supercenter in Plano , Texas at the corner of Park Blvd. and the Dallas North Tollway which was intended to compete against stores that some viewed as more upscale and appealing . The new store features wooden floors , wider aisles , a sushi bar , a coffee \/ sandwich shop ( with free Wi - Fi Internet access ) , a Subway , and higher - end items such as microbrew beer , expensive wines , and high - end electronics . The exterior sports the less - common hunter green background behind the Walmart letters instead of the trademark blue . In response to the popularity of organic food supermarkets , such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats , Walmart announced plans in May 2006 , to increase the amount of organic food available in its stores . They announced that both conventionally grown and organic versions of certain products would be available , and the price of organic versions would not be more than 10 % over the price of conventionally grown products . Since Walmart is one of the nation 's largest grocery retailers , there was some concern expressed that their push to lower prices would not be sustainable for inexpensive organic food . Legal trouble ( edit ) Over the last decade or so Walmart has become involved in numerous lawsuits for a variety of reasons . The majority of the suits are class action lawsuits in which employees are suing for unpaid wages . They have also run into numerous discrimination cases in which employees are suing for being profiled out of money or out of jobs . For example , there were two separate cases , one in 2004 and one in 2005 , in which black employees were suing two different Walmarts for denying them jobs based on race . These became so popular that the reverend Jesse Jackson intervened and spoke during both of the proceedings . There are also many lawsuits in which women are suing Wal - Mart for discriminating against them . In one article written in 2004 USA today mentioned 32 different lawsuits that involved women suing Walmart . But still Walmart has prevailed . All of this has not had any effects on Walmart financially however , according to Fortune 500 , Walmart still had $351 billion in revenue ( $11 billion in profit ) in 2007 , a new high for the corporation . On December 3 , 2008 , the family of Walmart service worker Jdimytai Damour , who was killed by a stampede of shoppers frantically entering a Walmart store in Valley Stream , New York on Black Friday ( November 28 ) , filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the corporation ; Damour 's family alleged Walmart of encouraging a mass number of customers to come to the store simultaneously . In addition , the Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Walmart for `` ... inadequate crowd management following the Nov. 28 , 2008 , death of an employee at its Valley Stream , New York , store . The worker died of asphyxiation after being knocked to the ground and trampled by a crowd of about 2,000 shoppers who surged into the store for its annual ' Blitz Friday ' pre-holiday sales event . '' The company went on to spend an estimated $2 million in legal fees fighting OSHA 's $7,000 fine , because it apparently wished to prevent OSHA from establishing a precedent that would enable OSHA to influence Walmart 's crowd control measures in the future . Countries of operation ( edit ) As of October 2009 , Walmart stores operate in Argentina , Brazil , Canada , Chile , China , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , India , Japan , Mexico , Nicaragua , Puerto Rico , the United Kingdom , and the United States .

Ash Wednesday A cross of ashes \/ dust on a worshiper 's forehead Observed by Many Western Christians Observances Holy Mass , Service of worship , Divine Service , Divine Liturgy Placing of ashes on the head Date Wednesday in seventh week before Easter 2017 date March 1 2018 date February 14 2019 date March 6 2020 date February 26 Frequency Annual Related to Shrove Tuesday \/ Mardi Gras Carnival Lent Easter Ash Wednesday is a Christian holy day of prayer , fasting and repentance . It is preceded by Shrove Tuesday and falls on the first day of Lent , the six weeks of penitence before Easter . Ash Wednesday is observed by many Western Christians , including Anglicans , Lutherans , Old Catholics , Methodists , Presbyterians , Roman Catholics , and some Baptists . Ash Wednesday derives its name from the placing of repentance ashes on the foreheads of participants to either the words `` Repent , and believe in the Gospel '' or the dictum `` Remember that you are dust , and to dust you shall return . '' The ashes may be prepared by burning palm leaves from the previous year 's Palm Sunday celebrations . Because it is the first day of Lent , many Christians , on Ash Wednesday , often begin marking a Lenten calendar , praying a Lenten daily devotional , and abstaining from a luxury that they will not partake in until Easter Sunday arrives .

The First Council of Nic\u00e6a spoke of Lent as a period of fasting for forty days , in preparation for Eastertide . In many places , Christians historically abstained from food for a whole day until the evening , and at sunset , Western Christians traditionally broke the Lenten fast , which is often known as the Black Fast . In India and Pakistan , many Christians continue this practice of fasting until sunset on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday , with some fasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent . In the Roman Catholic Church , Ash Wednesday is observed by fasting , abstinence from meat , and repentance -- a day of contemplating one 's transgressions . On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday , Roman Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59 ( whose health enables them to do so ) are permitted to consume only one full meal , which may be supplemented by two smaller meals , which together should not equal the full meal . Some Catholics will go beyond the minimum obligations demanded by the Church and undertake a complete fast or a bread and water fast until sunset . Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also days of abstinence from meat ( mammals and fowl ) , as are all Fridays during Lent . Some Roman Catholics continue fasting throughout Lent , as was the Church 's traditional requirement , concluding only after the celebration of the Easter Vigil . Where the Ambrosian Rite is observed , the day of fasting and abstinence is postponed to the first Friday in the Ambrosian Lent , nine days later . Many Lutheran parishes teach communicants to fast on Ash Wednesday , with some people choosing to continue doing so throughout the entire season of Lent , especially on Good Friday . A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent recommends the Lutheran guideline to `` Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day , usually without meat '' . In the Anglican Communion , the entire forty days of Lent are designated days of fasting and abstinence in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer , with the Traditional Saint Augustine 's Prayer Book : A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion defining `` Fasting , usually meaning not more than a light breakfast , one full meal , and one half meal , on the forty days of Lent . '' The same text defines abstinence as refraining from flesh meat on all Fridays of the Church Year , except for those during Christmastide . The historic Methodist homilies regarding the Sermon on the Mount stress the importance of the Lenten fast , which begins on Ash Wednesday . The United Methodist Church therefore states that : There is a strong biblical base for fasting , particularly during the 40 days of Lent leading to the celebration of Easter . Jesus , as part of his spiritual preparation , went into the wilderness and fasted 40 days and 40 nights , according to the Gospels . Rev. Jacqui King , the minister of Nu Faith Community United Methodist Church in Houston explained the philosophy of fasting during Lent as `` I 'm not skipping a meal because in place of that meal I 'm actually dining with God '' . The Reformed Church in America describes Ash Wednesday as a day `` focused on prayer , fasting , and repentance . '' The liturgy for Ash Wednesday thus contains the following `` Invitation to Observe a Lenten Discipline '' read by the presider : We begin this holy season by acknowledging our need for repentance and our need for the love and forgiveness shown to us in Jesus Christ . I invite you , therefore , in the name of Christ , to observe a Holy Lent , by self - examination and penitence , by prayer and fasting , by practicing works of love , and by reading and reflecting on God 's Holy Word . Many of the Churches in the Reformed tradition retained the Lenten fast in its entirety , although it was made voluntary , rather than obligatory . Ashes ( edit ) A priest marks a cross of ashes on a worshipper 's forehead , the prevailing form in English - speaking countries . Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Christians on Ash Wednesday , either by being sprinkled over their heads or , in English - speaking countries , more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross . The words ( based on Genesis 3 : 19 ) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are , `` Memento , homo , quia pulvis es , et in pulverem reverteris . '' ( `` Remember , man , that thou art dust , and to dust thou shalt return . '' ) This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great ( c. 540 -- 604 ) . In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite , an alternative formula ( based on Mark 1 : 15 ) was introduced and given first place `` Repent , and believe in the Gospel '' and the older formula was translated as `` Remember that you are dust , and to dust you shall return . '' The old formula , based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin , reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus , implicitly , of their need to repent in time . The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old . Various manners of placing the ashes on worshippers ' heads are in use within the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church , the two most common being to use the ashes to make a cross on the forehead and sprinkling the ashes over the crown of the head . Originally , the ashes were strewn over men 's heads , but , probably because women had their heads covered in church , were placed on the foreheads of women . In the Catholic Church the manner of imposing ashes depends largely on local custom , since no fixed rule has been laid down . Although the account of \u00c6lfric of Eynsham shows that in about the year 1000 the ashes were `` strewn '' on the head , the marking of the forehead is the method that now prevails in English - speaking countries and is the only one envisaged in the Occasional Offices of the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea , a publication described as `` noticeably Anglo - Catholic in character '' . In its ritual of `` Blessing of Ashes '' , this states that `` the ashes are blessed at the beginning of the Eucharist ; and after they have been blessed they are placed on the forehead of the clergy and people . '' The Ash Wednesday ritual of the Church of England , Mother Church of the Anglican Communion , contains `` The Imposition of Ashes '' in its Ash Wednesday liturgy . On Ash Wednesday , the Pope , the Bishop of Rome , traditionally takes part in a penitential procession from the Church of Saint Anselm to the Basilica of Santa Sabina , where , in accordance with the custom in Italy and many other countries , ashes are sprinkled on his head , not smudged on his forehead , and he places ashes on the heads of others in the same way . A woman receives a cross of ashes on Ash Wednesday outside an Episcopal church The Anglican ritual , used in Papua New Guinea states that , after the blessing of the ashes , `` the priest marks his own forehead and then the foreheads of the servers and congregation who come and kneel , or stand , where they normally receive the Blessed Sacrament . '' The corresponding Catholic ritual in the Roman Missal for celebration within Mass merely states : `` Then the Priest places ashes on the head of those present who come to him , and says to each one ... '' Pre-1970 editions had much more elaborate instructions about the order in which the participants were to receive the ashes , but again without any indication of the form of placing the ashes on the head . The 1969 revision of the Roman Rite inserted into the Mass the solemn ceremony of blessing ashes and placing them on heads , but also explicitly envisaged a similar solemn ceremony outside of Mass . The Book of Blessings contains a simple rite . While the solemn rite would normally be carried out within a church building , the simple rite could appropriately be used almost anywhere . While only a priest or deacon may bless the ashes , laypeople may do the placing of the ashes on a person 's head . Even in the solemn rite , lay men or women may assist the priest in distributing the ashes . In addition , laypeople take blessed ashes left over after the collective ceremony and place them on the head of the sick or of others who are unable to attend the blessing . ( In 2014 , Anglican Liverpool Cathedral likewise offered to impose ashes within the church without a solemn ceremony . ) In addition , those who attend such Catholic services , whether in a church or elsewhere , traditionally take blessed ashes home with them to place on the heads of other members of the family , and it is recommended to have envelopes available to facilitate this practice . At home the ashes are then placed with little or no ceremony . Unlike its discipline regarding sacraments , the Catholic Church does not exclude from receiving sacramentals , such as the placing of ashes on the head , those who are not Catholics and perhaps not even baptized . Even those who have been excommunicated and are therefore forbidden to celebrate sacramentals are not forbidden to receive them . After describing the blessing , the rite of Blessing and Distribution of Ashes ( within Mass ) states : `` Then the Priest places ashes on the heads of all those present who come to him . '' The Catholic Church does not limit distribution of blessed ashes to within church buildings and has suggested the holding of celebrations in shopping centres , nursing homes , and factories . Such celebrations presume preparation of an appropriate area and include readings from Scripture ( at least one ) and prayers , and are somewhat shorter if the ashes are already blessed . The Catholic Church and the Methodist Church say that the ashes should be those of palm branches blessed at the previous year 's Palm Sunday service , while a Church of England publication says they `` may be made '' from the burnt palm crosses of the previous year . These sources do not speak of adding anything to the ashes other than , for the Catholic liturgy , a sprinkling with holy water when blessing them . An Anglican website speaks of mixing the ashes with a small amount of holy water or olive oil as a fixative . Where ashes are placed on the head by smudging the forehead with a sign of the cross , many Christians choose to keep the mark visible throughout the day . The churches have not imposed this as an obligatory rule , and the ashes may even be wiped off immediately after receiving them ; but some Christian leaders , such as Lutheran pastor Richard P. Bucher and Catholic bishop Kieran Conry , recommend it as a public profession of faith . Morgan Guyton , a Methodist pastor and leader in the Red - Letter Christian movement , encourages Christians to wear their ashed cross throughout the day as an exercise of religious freedom . Ashes to Go ( edit ) Two Anglican priests distribute ashes to passerby in the American city of Boca Raton as part of the Ashes to Go movement Since 2007 , some members of major Christian Churches , including Anglicans , Catholics , Lutherans , and Methodists , have participated in the Ashes to Go program , in which clergy go outside of their churches to public places , such as downtowns , sidewalks and train stations , to distribute ashes to passersby , even to people waiting in their cars for a stoplight to change . The Anglican priest Emily Mellott of Calvary Church in Lombard took up the idea and turned it into a movement , stated that the practice was also an act of evangelism . Anglicans and Catholics in parts of the United Kingdom such as Sunderland , are offering Ashes to Go together : Marc Lyden - Smith , the priest of Saint Mary 's Church , stated that the ecumenical effort is a `` tremendous witness in our city , with Catholics and Anglicans working together to start the season of Lent , perhaps reminding those who have fallen away from the Church , or have never been before , that the Christian faith is alive and active in Sunderland . '' The Catholic Student Association of Kent State University , based at the University Parish Newman Center , offered ashes to university students who were going through the Student Center of that institution in 2012 , and Douglas Clark of St. Matthew 's Roman Catholic Church in Statesboro , among others , have participated in Ashes to Go . On Ash Wednesday 2017 , Father Paddy Mooney , the priest of St Patrick 's Roman Catholic Church in the Irish town of Glenamaddy , set up an Ashes to Go station through which commuters could drive and receive ashes from their car ; the parish church also had `` drive - through prayers during Lent with people submitting requests into a box left in the church grounds without having to leave their car '' . Reverend Trey Hall , pastor of Urban Village United Methodist Church , stated that when his local church offered ashes in Chicago `` nearly 300 people received ashes -- including two people who were waiting in their car for a stoplight to change . '' In 2013 , churches not only in the United States , but also at least one church each in the United Kingdom , Canada and South Africa , participated in Ashes to Go . Outside of their church building , Saint Stephen Martyr Lutheran Church in Canton offered Ashes to Go for `` believers whose schedules make it difficult to attend a traditional service '' in 2016 . In the United States itself 34 states and the District of Columbia had at least one church taking part . Most of these churches ( parishes ) were Episcopal , but there were also several Methodist churches , as well as Presbyterian and Catholic churches . Commination Office ( edit ) The chancel of Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church on Ash Wednesday 2015 ( the veiled altar cross and purple paraments are customary during Lent ) Robin Knowles Wallace states that the traditional Ash Wednesday church service includes Psalm 51 ( the Miserere ) , prayers of confession and the sign of ashes . No single one of the traditional services contains all of these elements . The Anglican church 's traditional Ash Wednesday service , titled A Commination , contains the first two elements , but not the third . On the other hand , the Catholic Church 's traditional service has the blessing and distribution of ashes but , while prayers of confession and recitation of Psalm 51 ( the first psalm at Lauds on all penitential days , including Ash Wednesday ) are a part of its general traditional Ash Wednesday liturgy , they are not associated specifically with the rite of blessing the ashes . The rite of blessing has acquired an untraditional weak association with that particular psalm only since 1970 , when it was inserted into the celebration of Mass , at which a few verses of Psalm 51 are used as a responsorial psalm . Coincidentally , it was only about the same time that in some areas Anglicanism resumed the rite of ashes . In the mid-16th century , the first Book of Common Prayer removed the ceremony of the ashes from the liturgy of the Church of England and replaced it with what would later be called the Commination Office . In that 1549 edition , the rite was headed : `` The First Day of Lent : Commonly Called Ash - Wednesday '' . The ashes ceremony was not forbidden , but was not included in the church 's official liturgy . Its place was taken by reading biblical curses of God against sinners , to each of which the people were directed to respond with Amen . The text of the `` Commination or Denouncing of God 's Anger and Judgments against Sinners '' begins : `` In the primitive Church there was a godly discipline , that , at the beginning of Lent , such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance , and punished in this world , that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord ; and that others , admonished by their example , might be the more afraid to offend . Instead whereof , until the said discipline may be restored again , ( which is much to be wished , ) it is thought good that at this time ( in the presence of you all ) should be read the general sentences of God 's cursing against impenitent sinners '' . In line with this , Joseph Hooper Maude wrote that the establishment of The Commination was due to a desire of the reformers `` to restore the primitive practice of public penance in church '' . He further stated that `` the sentences of the greater excommunication '' within The Commination corresponded to those used in the ancient Church . The Anglican Church 's Ash Wednesday liturgy , he wrote , also traditionally included the Miserere , which , along with `` what follows '' in the rest of the service ( lesser Litany , Lord 's Prayer , three prayers for pardon and final blessing ) , `` was taken from the Sarum services for Ash Wednesday '' . From the Sarum Rite practice in England the service took Psalm 51 and some prayers that in the Sarum Missal accompanied the blessing and distribution of ashes . In the Sarum Rite , the Miserere psalm was one of the seven penitential psalms that were recited at the beginning of the ceremony . In the 20th century , the Episcopal Church introduced three prayers from the Sarum Rite and omitted the Commination Office from its liturgy . Low Church Ceremonies ( edit ) In some of the low church traditions , other practices are sometimes added or substituted , as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day . For example , in one common variation , small cards are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess . These small cards are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned . Regional customs ( edit ) In Victorian era , theatres refrained from presenting costumed shows on Ash Wednesday , so they provided other entertainment , as mandated by the Church of England ( Anglican Church ) . Also , `` in Iceland , on Ash Wednesday children pin small bags of ashes on the back of some unsuspecting person '' . Biblical significance of ashes ( edit ) Ashes were used in ancient times to express grief . When Tamar was raped by her half - brother , `` she sprinkled ashes on her head , tore her robe , and with her face buried in her hands went away crying '' ( 2 Samuel 13 : 19 ) . The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults . In Job 42 : 3 -- 6 , Job says to God : `` I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear : but now mine eye seeth thee . Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . '' The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying : `` O daughter of my people , gird on sackcloth , roll in the ashes '' ( Jer 6 : 26 ) . The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God : `` I turned to the Lord God , pleading in earnest prayer , with fasting , sackcloth and ashes '' ( Daniel 9 : 3 ) . Just prior to the New Testament period , the rebels fighting for Jewish independence , the Maccabees , prepared for battle using ashes : `` That day they fasted and wore sackcloth ; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes '' ( 1 Maccabees 3 : 47 ; see also 4 : 39 ) . Examples of the practice among Jews are found in several other books of the Bible , including Numbers 19 : 9 , 19 : 17 , Jonah 3 : 6 , Book of Esther 4 : 1 , and Hebrews 9 : 13 . Jesus is quoted as speaking of the practice in Matthew 11 : 21 and Luke 10 : 13 : `` If the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago ( sitting ) in sackcloth and ashes . '' Christian use of ashes ( edit ) An 1881 Polish painting of a Roman Catholic priest sprinkling ashes on the heads of worshippers , the form prevailing in , for instance , Italy , Spain , and parts of Latin America Christians continued the practice of using ashes as an external sign of repentance . Tertullian ( c. 160 -- c. 225 ) said that confession of sin should be accompanied by lying in sackcloth and ashes . The historian Eusebius ( c. 260 \/ 265 -- 339 \/ 340 ) recounts how a repentant apostate covered himself with ashes when begging Pope Zephyrinus to readmit him to communion . John W. Fenton writes that `` by the end of the 10th century , it was customary in Western Europe ( but not yet in Rome ) for all the faithful to receive ashes on the first day of the Lenten fast . In 1091 , this custom was then ordered by Pope Urban II at the council of Benevento to be extended to the church in Rome . Not long after that , the name of the day was referred to in the liturgical books as `` Feria Quarta Cinerum '' ( i.e. , Ash Wednesday ) . '' The public penance that grave sinners underwent before being admitted to Holy Communion just before Easter lasted throughout Lent , on the first day of which they were sprinkled with ashes and dressed in sackcloth . When , towards the end of the first millennium , the discipline of public penance was dropped , the beginning of Lent , seen as a general penitential season , was marked by sprinkling ashes on the heads of all . This practice is found in the Gregorian Sacramentary of the late 8th century . About two centuries later , \u00c6lfric of Eynsham , an Anglo - Saxon abbot , wrote of the rite of strewing ashes on heads at the start of Lent . A Lutheran pastor distributes ashes to a communicant during a Divine Service The article on Ash Wednesday in the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica says that , after the Protestant Reformation , the ashes ceremony was not forbidden in the Church of England , a statement that may explain the research by Blair Meeks that the Anglican tradition `` never lapsed in this observance '' . It was even prescribed under King Henry VIII in 1538 and under King Edward VI in 1550 , but it fell out of use in many areas after 1600 . In 1536 , the Ten Articles issued by authority of Henry VIII commended `` the observance of various rites and ceremonies as good and laudable , such as clerical vestments , sprinkling of holy water , bearing of candles on Candlemas - day , giving of ashes on Ash - Wednesday '' . After Henry 's death in January 1547 , Thomas Cranmer , within the same year , `` procured an order from the Council to forbid the carrying of candles on Candlemas - day , and the use of ashes on Ash - Wednesday , and of palms on Palm - Sunday , as superstitious ceremonies '' , an order that was issued only for the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury , of which Cranmer was archbishop . The Church Cyclop\u00e6dia states that the `` English office had adapted the very old Salisbury service for Ash - Wednesday , prefacing it with an address and a recital of the curses of Mount Ebal , and then with an exhortation uses the older service very nearly as it stood . '' The new Commination Office had no blessing of ashes and therefore , in England as a whole , `` soon after the Reformation , the use of ashes was discontinued as a ' vain show ' and Ash Wednesday then became only a day of marked solemnity , with a memorial of its original character in a reading of the curses denounced against impenitent sinners '' . The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America , in the 19th century , observed Ash Wednesday : `` as a day of fasting and humiliation , wherein we are publicly to confess our sins , meekly to implore God 's mercy and forgiveness , and humbly to intercede for the continuance of his favour '' . In the 20th century , the Book of Common Prayer provided prayers for the imposition of ashes . An Episcopal priest has an Ashes to Go station for commuters at the Metro - North Railroad in the American state of Connecticut Monte Canfield and Blair Meeks state that after the Protestant Reformation , Anglicans and Lutherans kept the rite of blessing and distributing ashes to the faithful on Ash Wednesday , and that the Protestant denominations that did not keep it encouraged its use `` during and after the ecumenical era that resulted in the Vatican II proclamations '' . Jack Kingsbury and Russell F. Anderson likewise state that the practice was continued among some Anglicans and Lutherans . On the other hand , Edward Traill Horn wrote : `` The ceremony of the distribution of the ashes was not retained by the reformers , whether Lutheran , Anglican or Reformed '' , although these denominations honored Ash Wednesday as the first day of Lent . Frank Senn , a liturgical scholar , has been quoted as saying : `` How and why the use of ashes fell out of Lutheran use is difficult to discern from the sources ... ( C ) hurch orders do n't specifically say not to use ashes ; they simply stopped giving direction for blessing and distributing them and eventually the pastors just stopped doing it . '' As part of the liturgical revival ushered in by the ecumenical movement , the practice was encouraged in Protestant churches , including the Methodist Church . It has also been adopted by Anabaptist and Reformed churches and some less liturgical denominations . The Eastern Orthodox churches generally do not observe Ash Wednesday , although in recent times , the creation of the Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate has led to the observance of Ash Wednesday among Western Orthodox parishes . In this tradition , ashes `` may be distributed outside of the mass or any liturgical service '' although `` commonly the faithful receive their ashes immediately before the Ash Wednesday mass '' . In Orthodoxy , historically , `` serious public sinners in the East also donned sackcloth , including those who made the Great Fast a major theme of their entire lives such as hermits and desert - dwellers . '' Byzantine Catholics , although in the United States use `` the same Gregorian calendar as the Roman Catholic rite '' , do not practice the distribution of ashes as it is `` not part of their ancient tradition '' . In the Ambrosian Rite , ashes are blessed and placed on the heads of the faithful not on the day that elsewhere is called Ash Wednesday , but at the end of Mass on the following Sunday , which in that rite inaugurates Lent , with the fast traditionally beginning on Monday , the first weekday of the Ambrosian Lent . Lent ( edit ) Ash Wednesday by Carl Spitzweg : the end of Carnival Ash Wednesday marks the start of a 40 - day period which is an allusion to the separation of Jesus in the desert to fast and pray . During this time he was tempted . Matthew 4 : 1 -- 11 , Mark 1 : 12 -- 13 , and Luke 4 : 1 -- 13 . While not specifically instituted in the Bible text , the 40 - day period of repentance is also analogous to the 40 days during which Moses repented and fasted in response to the making of the Golden calf. ( Exo. 34 : 27 -- 28 ) ( Jews today follow a 40 - day period of repenting in preparation for and during the High Holy Days from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur . ) Dates ( edit ) Ash Wednesday is exactly 46 days before Easter Sunday , a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon . The earliest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 4 February ( which is only possible during a common year with Easter on 22 March ) , which happened in 1598 , 1693 , 1761 and 1818 and will next occur in 2285 . The latest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 10 March ( when Easter Day falls on 25 April ) which occurred in 1666 , 1734 , 1886 and 1943 and will next occur in 2038 . Ash Wednesday has never occurred on Leap Year Day ( 29 February ) , and it will not occur as such until 2096 . The only other years of the third millennium that will have Ash Wednesday on 29 February are 2468 , 2688 , 2840 and 2992 . ( Ash Wednesday falls on 29 February only if Easter is on 15 April in a leap year starting on a Sunday . ) Observing churches ( edit ) A Methodist minister distributing ashes to confirmands kneeling at the chancel rails Ash Wednesday in 2016 A Lutheran clergyman distributes ashes during the Holy Mass at Nazareth Evangelical Lutheran Church in Cedar Falls , Iowa on Ash Wednesday ( 2017 ) These Christian Churches are among those that mark Ash Wednesday with a particular liturgy or service .

There are , however , a relatively small number of Orthodox Christians who follow the Western Rite ; these do observe Ash Wednesday , although often on a different day from the previously mentioned denominations , as its date is determined from the Orthodox calculation of Pascha , which may be as much as a month later than the Western observance of Easter . National no Smoking day ( edit ) In the Republic of Ireland , Ash Wednesday is National No Smoking Day . The date was chosen because quitting smoking ties in with giving up luxury for Lent . In the United Kingdom No Smoking Day was held for the first time on Ash Wednesday 1984 but is now fixed as the second Wednesday in March . Notes ( edit ) Jump up ^ Not all Catholics observe Ash Wednesday . Eastern Catholic Churches , who do not count Holy Week as part of Lent , begin the penitential season on Clean Monday , the Monday before Ash Wednesday , and Catholics who follow the Ambrosian Rite begin it on the First Sunday in Lent . Ashes are blessed and ceremonially distributed at the start of Lent throughout the Latin Church and in the Maronite Catholic Church and the Syro - Malabar Catholic Church . In the Ambrosian Rite , this is done at the end of the Sunday Mass or on the following day ( see Il Sussidiario , Giorno delle Ceneri : Cos'\u00e8 il rito delle Ceneri Archived 14 July 2014 at the Wayback Machine . & Sapere , Perch\u00e9 il Carnevale ambrosiano si festeggia in ritardo rispetto al resto d'Italia ?

It is the successor to PlayStation 2 , and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles . It was first released on November 11 , 2006 , in Japan , November 17 , 2006 , in North America , and March 23 , 2007 , in Europe and Australia . The PlayStation 3 mainly competed against consoles such as Microsoft 's Xbox 360 and Nintendo 's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles . The console was first officially announced at E3 2005 , and was released at the end of 2006 . It was the first console to use Blu - ray Disc as its primary storage medium . The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services , including being the first to introduce Sony 's social gaming service , PlayStation Network , and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita , being able to remote control the console from the devices . In September 2009 , the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released . It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games . It was lighter and thinner than the original version , and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design , as well as a minor start - up change in software . A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012 , further refining and redesigning the console . The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover , particularly after the introduction of the Slim model . Its successor , the PlayStation 4 , was released later in November 2013 . On September 29 , 2015 , Sony confirmed that sales of the PlayStation 3 were to be discontinued in New Zealand , but the system remained in production in other markets . Shipments of new units to the United States ended in October 2016 . Heading into 2017 , Japan was the last territory where new units were still being produced until May 29 , 2017 when Sony confirmed the PlayStation 3 was discontinued in Japan .

A functional version of the system was not present there , nor at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005 , although demonstrations ( such as Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots ) were held at both events on software development kits and comparable personal computer hardware . Video footage based on the predicted PlayStation 3 specifications was also shown ( notably a Final Fantasy VII tech demo ) . The initial prototype shown in May 2005 featured two HDMI ports , three Ethernet ports and six USB ports ; however , when the system was shown again a year later at E3 2006 , these were reduced to one HDMI port , one Ethernet port and four USB ports , presumably to cut costs . Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console : a 20 GB model and a 60 GB model , priced at US $499 ( \u20ac 499 ) and US $599 ( \u20ac 599 ) , respectively . The 60 GB model was to be the only configuration to feature an HDMI port , Wi - Fi internet , flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver . Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release : November 11 , 2006 , for Japan and November 17 , 2006 , for North America and Europe . On September 6 , 2006 , Sony announced that PAL region PlayStation 3 launch would be delayed until March 2007 , because of a shortage of materials used in the Blu - ray drive . At the Tokyo Game Show on September 22 , 2006 , Sony announced that it would include an HDMI port on the 20 GB system , but a chrome trim , flash card readers , silver logo and Wi - Fi would not be included . Also , the launch price of the Japanese 20 GB model was reduced by over 20 % , and the 60 GB model was announced for an open pricing scheme in Japan . During the event , Sony showed 27 playable PS3 games running on final hardware . Launch Silver PlayStation 3 consoles on show in 2006 PlayStation 3 was first released in Japan on November 11 , 2006 , at 07 : 00 . According to Media Create , 81,639 PS3 systems were sold within 24 hours of its introduction in Japan . Soon after its release in Japan , PS3 was released in North America on November 17 , 2006 . Reports of violence surrounded the release of PS3 . A customer was shot , campers were robbed at gunpoint , customers were shot in a drive - by shooting with BB guns , and 60 campers fought over 10 systems . The console was originally planned for a global release through November , but at the start of September the release in Europe and the rest of the world was delayed until March . With it being a somewhat last - minute delay , some companies had taken deposits for pre-orders , at which Sony informed customers that they were eligible for full refunds or could continue the pre-order . On January 24 , 2007 , Sony announced that PlayStation 3 would go on sale on March 23 , 2007 , in Europe , Australia , the Middle East , Africa and New Zealand . The system sold about 600,000 units in its first two days . On March 7 , 2007 , the 60 GB PlayStation 3 launched in Singapore with a price of S $ 799 . The console was launched in South Korea on June 16 , 2007 , as a single version equipped with an 80 GB hard drive and IPTV . Slim model 120 GB Slim model Following speculation that Sony was working on a ' slim ' model , Sony officially announced the PS3 CECH - 2000 model on August 18 , 2009 , at the Sony Gamescom press conference . New features included a slimmer form factor , decreased power consumption , and a quieter cooling system . It was released in major territories by September 2009 . At the same time , a new logo was introduced for the console to replace the previous `` Spider - Man '' wordmarks ( named due to their use of the same font as the logos of Sony 's then - current Spider - Man films ) , with a new `` PS3 '' wordmark evoking the design of the PlayStation 2 wordmark replacing the capitalized PlayStation 3 lettering . Super Slim model 250GB Super Slim model In September 2012 at the Tokyo Game Show , Sony announced that a new , slimmer PS3 redesign ( CECH - 4000 ) was due for release in late 2012 and that it would be available with either a 250 GB or 500 GB hard drive . Three versions of the Super Slim model were revealed : one with a 500 GB hard drive , a second with a 250 GB hard drive which is not available in PAL regions , and a third with a 12 GB flash storage that was available in PAL regions , and in Canada . The storage of 12 GB model is upgradable with an official standalone 250 GB hard drive . A vertical stand was also released for the model . In the United Kingdom , the 500 GB model was released on September 28 , 2012 ; and the 12 GB model was released on October 12 , 2012 . In the United States , the PS3 Super Slim was first released as a bundled console . The 250 GB model was bundled with the Game of the Year edition of Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception and released on September 25 , 2012 ; and the 500 GB model was bundled with Assassin 's Creed III and released on October 30 , 2012 . In Japan , the black colored Super Slim model was released on October 4 , 2012 ; and the white colored Super Slim model was released on November 22 , 2012 . The Super Slim model is 20 percent smaller and 25 percent lighter than the Slim model and features a manual sliding disc cover instead of a motorized slot - loading disc cover of the Slim model . The white colored Super Slim model was released in the United States on January 27 , 2013 as part of the Instant Game Collection Bundle . The Garnet Red and Azurite Blue colored models were launched in Japan on February 28 , 2013 . The Garnet Red version was released in North America on March 12 , 2013 as part of the God of War : Ascension bundle with 500 GB storage and contained God of War : Ascension as well as the God of War Saga . The Azurite Blue model was released as a GameStop exclusive with 250GB storage . Games Main article : Lists of PlayStation 3 games PlayStation 3 launched in North America with 14 titles , with another three being released before the end of 2006 . After the first week of sales it was confirmed that Resistance : Fall of Man from Insomniac Games was the top - selling launch game in North America . The game was heavily praised by numerous video game websites , including GameSpot and IGN , both of whom awarded it their PlayStation 3 Game of the Year award for 2006 . Some titles missed the launch window and were delayed until early 2007 , such as The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , F.E.A.R. and Sonic the Hedgehog . During the Japanese launch , Ridge Racer 7 was the top - selling game , while Mobile Suit Gundam : Crossfire also fared well in sales , both of which were offerings from Namco Bandai Games . PlayStation 3 launched in Europe with 24 titles , including ones that were not offered in North American and Japanese launches , such as Formula One Championship Edition , MotorStorm and Virtua Fighter 5 . Resistance : Fall of Man and MotorStorm were the most successful titles of 2007 , and both games subsequently received sequels in the form of Resistance 2 and MotorStorm : Pacific Rift . At E3 2007 , Sony was able to show a number of their upcoming video games for PlayStation 3 , including Heavenly Sword , Lair , Ratchet & Clank Future : Tools of Destruction , Warhawk and Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune ; all of which were released in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 . It also showed off a number of titles that were set for release in 2008 and 2009 ; most notably Killzone 2 , Infamous , Gran Turismo 5 Prologue , LittleBigPlanet and SOCOM : U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation . A number of third - party exclusives were also shown , including the highly anticipated Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , alongside other high - profile third - party titles such as Grand Theft Auto IV , Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , Assassin 's Creed , Devil May Cry 4 and Resident Evil 5 . Two other important titles for PlayStation 3 , Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy Versus XIII , were shown at TGS 2007 in order to appease the Japanese market . Sony have since launched their budget range of PlayStation 3 titles , known as the Greatest Hits range in North America , the Platinum range in Europe and Australia and The Best range in Japan . Among the titles available in the budget range include Resistance : Fall of Man , MotorStorm , Uncharted : Drakes Fortune , Rainbow Six : Vegas , Call Of Duty 3 , Assassin 's Creed and Ninja Gaiden Sigma . As of October 2009 Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots , Ratchet & Clank Future : Tools of Destruction , Devil May Cry 4 , Army of Two , Battlefield : Bad Company and Midnight Club : Los Angeles have also joined the list . As of March 31 , 2012 , there have been 595 million games sold for PlayStation 3 . The best selling PS3 games are Grand Theft Auto V , Gran Turismo 5 , The Last Of Us , Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception and Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves Stereoscopic 3D Main article : List of PlayStation 3 games with 3D support In December 2008 , the CTO of Blitz Games announced that it would bring stereoscopic 3D gaming and movie viewing to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 with its own technology . This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony 's own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show . Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future . Firmware update 3.30 officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in 3D , requiring a compatible display for use . System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films . While the game itself must be programmed to take advantage of the 3D technology , titles may be patched to add in the functionality retroactively . Titles with such patches include Wipeout HD , Pain , and Super Stardust HD . Hardware Main article : PlayStation 3 hardware The PlayStation 3 was the first console to include an HDMI port . PlayStation 3 is convex on its left side , with the PlayStation logo upright , when vertical ( the top side is convex when horizontal ) and has a glossy black finish . PlayStation designer Teiyu Goto stated that the Spider - Man - font - inspired logo `` was one of the first elements SCEI president Ken Kutaragi decided on and the logo may have been the motivating force behind the shape of PS3 '' . On March 22 , 2007 , SCE and Stanford University released the Folding@home software for PlayStation 3 . This program allows PS3 owners to lend the computing power of their consoles to help study the process of protein folding for disease research . Use in supercomputing Main article : PlayStation 3 cluster PS3 's hardware has also been used to build supercomputers for high - performance computing . Fixstars Solutions sells a version of Yellow Dog Linux for PlayStation 3 ( originally sold by Terra Soft Solutions ) . RapidMind produced a stream programming package for PS3 , but were acquired by Intel in 2009 . Also , on January 3 , 2007 , Dr. Frank Mueller , Associate Professor of Computer science at NCSU , clustered 8 PS3s . Mueller commented that the 256 MB of system RAM is a limitation for this particular application and is considering attempting to retrofit more RAM . Software includes : Fedora Core 5 Linux ppc64 , MPICH2 , OpenMP v 2.5 , GNU Compiler Collection and CellSDK 1.1 . As a more cost - effective alternative to conventional supercomputers , the U.S. military has purchased clusters of PS3 units for research purposes . Retail PS3 Slim units can not be used for supercomputing , because PS3 Slim lacks the ability to boot into a third - party OS . In December 2008 , a group of hackers used a cluster of 200 PlayStation 3 computers to crack SSL authentication . In November 2010 the Air Force Research Laboratory ( AFRL ) created a powerful supercomputer by connecting together 1,760 Sony PS3s which include 168 separate graphical processing units and 84 coordinating servers in a parallel array capable of performing 500 trillion floating - point operations per second ( 500 TFLOPS ) . As built the Condor Cluster was the 33rd largest supercomputer in the world and would be used to analyze high definition satellite imagery . Technical specifications Main article : PlayStation 3 technical specifications The RSX ' Reality Synthesizer ' on a PlayStation 3 motherboard PlayStation 3 features a slot - loading 2x speed Blu - ray Disc drive for games , Blu - ray movies , DVDs , CDs and other optical media . It was originally available with hard drives of 20 and 60 GB ( 20 GB model was not available in PAL regions ) but various sizes up to 500 GB have been made available since then ( see : model comparison ) . All PS3 models have user - upgradeable 2.5 '' SATA hard drives . PlayStation 3 uses the Cell microprocessor , designed by Sony , Toshiba and IBM , as its CPU , which is made up of one 3.2 GHz PowerPC - based `` Power Processing Element '' ( PPE ) and eight Synergistic Processing Elements ( SPEs ) . The eighth SPE is disabled to improve chip yields . Only six of the seven SPEs are accessible to developers as the seventh SPE is reserved by the console 's operating system . Graphics processing is handled by the NVIDIA RSX ' Reality Synthesizer ' , which can produce resolutions from 480i \/ 576i SD up to 1080p HD . PlayStation 3 has 256 MB of XDR DRAM main memory and 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory for the RSX . The system has Bluetooth 2.0 ( with support for up to seven Bluetooth devices ) , Gigabit Ethernet , USB 2.0 and HDMI 1.4 built in on all currently shipping models . Wi - Fi networking is also built - in on all but the 20 GB models , while a flash card reader ( compatible with Memory Stick , SD \/ MMC and CompactFlash \/ Microdrive media ) is built - in on 60 GB and CECHExx 80 GB models . Models Main article : PlayStation 3 models PlayStation 3 has been produced in various models : the original , the Slim , and the Super Slim . Successive models have added or removed various features . Controllers and accessories Main article : PlayStation 3 accessories DualShock 3 controller in hand Numerous accessories for the console have been developed . These accessories include the wireless Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers , the Logitech Driving Force GT , the Logitech Cordless Precision Controller , the BD Remote , the PlayStation Eye camera , and the PlayTV DVB - T tuner \/ digital video recorder accessory . At Sony 's E3 press conference in 2006 , the then standard wireless Sixaxis controller was announced . The controller was based on the same basic design as the PlayStation 2 's DualShock 2 controller but was wireless , lacked vibration capabilities , had a built - in accelerometer ( that could detect motion in three directional and three rotational axes ; six in total , hence the name Sixaxis ) and had a few cosmetic tweaks . At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show , Sony announced DualShock 3 ( trademarked DUALSHOCK 3 ) , a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as Sixaxis , but with vibration capability included . Hands - on accounts describe the controller as being noticeably heavier than the standard Sixaxis controller and capable of vibration forces comparable to DualShock 2 . It was released in Japan on November 11 , 2007 ; in North America on April 5 , 2008 ; in Australia on April 24 , 2008 ; in New Zealand on May 9 , 2008 ; in mainland Europe on July 2 , 2008 , and in the United Kingdom and Ireland on July 4 , 2008 . During E3 2009 , Sony unveiled plans to release a motion controller later to be named PlayStation Move at GDC 2010 . It was released on September 15 , 2010 , in Europe ; September 19 , 2010 , in North America and October 21 , 2010 , in Japan . On October 13 , 2010 , Sony announced an official surround sound system for PS3 through the official PlayStation YouTube channel . The PlayStation 3 can also use DualShock 4 controller initially via USB cable , but Firmware update 4.60 enabled wireless connection . Statistics regarding reliability Some original `` fat '' PS3 systems display a yellow light , indicating a non-specific failure . According to Ars Technica , the number of PlayStation 3 consoles that have experienced failure is well within the normal failure rates in the consumer electronics industry ; a 2009 study by SquareTrade , a warranty provider , found a two - year failure rate of 10 % for PlayStation 3s . In September 2009 , BBC 's Watchdog television program aired a report investigating the issue , calling it the `` yellow light of death '' ( YLOD ) . Among the consoles that experienced the failure , they found that it usually occurred 18 -- 24 months after purchase , while the standard Sony warranty covers one year after purchase . After this time period , PlayStation 3 owners can pay Sony a fixed fee for a refurbished console . Sony claimed that , according to its statistics of returned consoles , approximately 0.5 % of consoles were reported as showing the YLOD . In response to the televised report , Sony issued a document criticizing the program 's accuracy and conclusions ; specifically that the faults were evidence of a manufacturing defect . The document also complained that the report had been inappropriate in tone and might damage Sony 's brand name . Software Main articles : PlayStation 3 system software and List of PlayStation applications System software Sony has included the ability for the operating system , referred to as System Software , to be updated . The updates can be acquired in several ways : If PlayStation 3 has an active Internet connection , updates may be downloaded directly from the PlayStation Network to PlayStation 3 and subsequently installed . Systems with active Internet will automatically check online for software updates each time the console is started . Using an external PC , a user may download the update from the official PlayStation website , transfer it to portable storage media and install it on the system . Some game discs come with system software updates on the disc . This may be due to the game requiring the update in order to run . If so , the software may be installed from the disc . The original PlayStation 3 also included the ability to install other operating systems , such as Linux . This was not included in the newer slim models and was removed from all older PlayStation 3 consoles with the release of firmware update 3.21 in April 2010 . The functionality is now only available to users of original consoles who choose not to update their system software beyond version 3.15 or who have installed third - party , modified and unofficial versions of the firmware instead . Graphical user interface Main article : XrossMediaBar -- PlayStation 3 XMB The XrossMediaBar ( XMB ) used on the PS3 . The standard PlayStation 3 version of the XrossMediaBar ( pronounced Cross Media Bar , or abbreviated XMB ) includes nine categories of options . These are : Users , Settings , Photo , Music , Video , TV \/ Video Services , Game , Network , PlayStation Network and Friends ( similar to the PlayStation Portable media bar ) . TheTV \/ Video Services category is for services like Netflix and \/ or if PlayTV or torne is installed ; the first category in this section is `` My Channels '' , which lets users download various streaming services , including Sony 's own streaming services Crackle and PlayStation Vue . By default , the What 's New section of PlayStation Network is displayed when the system starts up . PS3 includes the ability to store various master and secondary user profiles , manage and explore photos with or without a musical slide show , play music and copy audio CD tracks to an attached data storage device , play movies and video files from the hard disk drive , an optical disc ( Blu - ray Disc or DVD - Video ) or an optional USB mass storage or Flash card , compatibility for a USB keyboard and mouse and a web browser supporting compatible - file download function . Additionally , UPnP media will appear in the respective audio \/ video \/ photo categories if a compatible media server or DLNA server is detected on the local network . The Friends menu allows mail with emoticon and attached picture features and video chat which requires an optional PlayStation Eye or EyeToy webcam . The Network menu allows online shopping through the PlayStation Store and connectivity to PlayStation Portable via Remote Play . Digital rights management PlayStation 3 console protects certain types of data and uses digital rights management to limit the data 's use . Purchased games and content from the PlayStation Network store are governed by PlayStation 's Network Digital Rights Management ( NDRM ) . The NDRM allows users to access the data from up to 2 different PlayStation 3 's that have been activated using a user 's PlayStation Network ID . PlayStation 3 also limits the transfer of copy protected videos downloaded from its store to other machines and states that copy protected video `` may not restore correctly '' following certain actions after making a backup such as downloading a new copy protected movie . Photo management Photo Gallery Photo Gallery main menu Photo Gallery is an optional application to view , create and group photos from PS3 , which is installed separately from the system software at 105 MB . It was introduced in system software version 2.60 and provides a range of tools for sorting through and displaying the system 's pictures . The key feature of this application is that it can organize photos into groups according to various criteria . Notable categorizations are colors , ages , or facial expressions of the people in the photos . Slideshows can be viewed with the application , along with music and playlists . The software was updated with the release of system software version 3.40 allowing users to upload and browse photos on Facebook and Picasa . PlayMemories Studio PlayMemories is an optional stereoscopic 3D ( and also standard ) photo viewing application , which is installed from the PlayStation Store at 956 MB . The application is dedicated specifically to 3D photos and features the ability to zoom into 3D environments and change the angle and perspective of panoramas . It requires system software 3.40 or higher ; 3D photos ; a 3D HDTV , and an HDMI cable for the 3D images to be viewed properly . Video services Video editor and uploader A new application was released as part of system software version 3.40 which allows users to edit videos on PlayStation 3 and upload them to the Internet . The software features basic video editing tools including the ability to cut videos and add music and captions . Videos can then be rendered and uploaded to video sharing websites such as Facebook and YouTube . Video on demand In addition to the video service provided by the Sony Entertainment Network , the PlayStation 3 console has access to a variety of third party video services , dependent on region : Since June 2009 , VidZone has offered a free music video streaming service in Europe , Australia and New Zealand . In October 2009 , Sony Computer Entertainment and Netflix announced that the Netflix streaming service would also be available on PlayStation 3 in the United States . A paid Netflix subscription was required for the service . The service became available in November 2009 . Initially users had to use a free Blu - ray disc to access the service ; however , in October 2010 the requirement to use a disc to gain access was removed . In April 2010 , support for MLB.tv was added , allowing MLB.tv subscribers to watch regular season games live in HD and access new interactive features designed exclusively for PSN . In November 2010 , access to the video and social networking site MUBI was enabled for European , New Zealand , and Australian users ; the service integrates elements of social networking with rental or subscription video streaming , allowing users to watch and discuss films with other users . Also in November 2010 the video rental service VUDU , NHL GameCenter Live , and subscription service Hulu Plus launched on PlayStation 3 in the United States . In August 2011 , Sony , in partnership with DirecTV , added NFL Sunday Ticket . Then in October 2011 , Best Buy launched an app for its CinemaNow service . In April 2012 , Amazon.com launched an Amazon Video app , accessible to Amazon Prime subscribers ( in the US ) . Upon reviewing the PlayStation and Netflix collaboration , Pocket - Lint said `` We 've used the Netflix app on Xbox too and , as good as it is , we think the PS3 version might have the edge here . '' and stated that having Netflix and LoveFilm on PlayStation is `` mind - blowingly good . '' In July 2013 , YuppTV OTT player launched its branded application on the PS3 computer entertainment system in the United States . OtherOS support Main article : OtherOS PlayStation 3 initially shipped with the ability to install an alternative operating system alongside the main system software ; Linux and other Unix - based operating systems were available . The hardware allowed access to six of the seven Synergistic Processing Elements of the Cell microprocessor , but not the RSX ' Reality Synthesizer ' graphics chip . The ' OtherOS ' functionality was not present in the updated PS Slim models , and the feature was subsequently removed from previous versions of the PS3 as part of the machine 's firmware update version 3.21 which was released on April 1 , 2010 ; Sony cited security concerns as the rationale . The firmware update 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network . The removal caused some controversy ; as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products , and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation . On December 8 , 2011 , U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg dismissed the last remaining count of the class action lawsuit ( other claims in the suit had previously been dismissed ) , stating : `` As a legal matter , ( ... ) plaintiffs have failed to allege facts or articulate a theory on which Sony may be held liable . '' As of January 2014 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partially reversed the dismissal and have sent the case back to the district court . Leap year bug On March 1 , 2010 ( UTC ) , many of the original `` fat '' PlayStation 3 models worldwide were experiencing errors related to their internal system clock . The error had many symptoms . Initially , the main problem seemed to be the inability to connect to the PlayStation Network . However , the root cause of the problem was unrelated to the PlayStation Network , since even users who had never been online also had problems playing installed offline games ( which queried the system timer as part of startup ) and using system themes . At the same time many users noted that the console 's clock had gone back to December 31 , 1999 . The event was nicknamed the ApocalyPS3 , a play on the word apocalypse and PS3 , the abbreviation for the PlayStation 3 console . The error code displayed was typically 8001050F and affected users were unable to sign in , play games , use dynamic themes and view \/ sync trophies . The problem only resided within the 1st through to the 3rd generation original PS3 units while the newer `` Slim '' models were unaffected because of different internal hardware for the clock . Sony confirmed that there was an error and stated that it was narrowing down the issue and were continuing to work to restore service . By March 2 ( UTC ) , 2010 , owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31 , 1999 . Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a leap year , because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date . However , for some users , the hardware 's operating system clock ( mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the internal clock ) needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet . On June 29 , 2010 , Sony released PS3 system software update 3.40 , which improved the functionality of the internal clock to properly account for leap years . Features PlayStation Portable connectivity Main articles : Remote Play and PlayStation Store ( PC ) for PSP PlayStation Portable can connect with PlayStation 3 in many ways , including in - game connectivity . For example , Formula One Championship Edition , a racing game , was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real - time rear - view mirror . In addition , users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store , transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself . It is also possible to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games , remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection . Sony has also demonstrated PSP playing back video content from PlayStation 3 hard disk across an ad hoc wireless network . This feature is referred to as Remote Play located under the browser icon on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable . Remote play has since expanded to allow remote access to PS3 via PSP from any wireless access point in the world . PlayStation Network Main article : PlayStation Network PlayStation Network is the unified online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service provided by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable , announced during the 2006 PlayStation Business Briefing meeting in Tokyo . The service is always connected , free , and includes multiplayer support . The network enables online gaming , the PlayStation Store , PlayStation Home and other services . PlayStation Network uses real currency and PlayStation Network Cards as seen with the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Home . PlayStation Plus Main article : PlayStation Plus PlayStation Plus ( commonly abbreviated PS+ and occasionally referred to as PSN Plus ) is a premium PlayStation Network subscription service that was officially unveiled at E3 2010 by Jack Tretton , President and CEO of SCEA . Rumors of such service had been in speculation since Kaz Hirai 's announcement at TGS 2009 of a possible paid service for PSN but with the current PSN service still available . Launched alongside PS3 firmware 3.40 and PSP firmware 6.30 on June 29 , 2010 , the paid - for subscription service provides users with enhanced services on the PlayStation Network , on top of the current PSN service which is still available with all of its features . These enhancements include the ability to have demos and game updates download automatically to PlayStation 3 . Subscribers also get early or exclusive access to some betas , game demos , premium downloadable content and other PlayStation Store items . North American users also get a free subscription to Qore . Users may choose to purchase either a one - year or a three - month subscription to PlayStation Plus . PlayStation Store Main article : PlayStation Store The PlayStation Store is an online virtual market available to users of Sony 's PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) and PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) game consoles via the PlayStation Network . The Store offers a range of downloadable content both for purchase and available free of charge . Available content includes full games , add - on content , playable demos , themes and game and movie trailers . The service is accessible through an icon on the XMB on PS3 and PSP . The PS3 store can also be accessed on PSP via a Remote Play connection to PS3 . The PSP store is also available via the PC application , Media Go . As of September 24 , 2009 , there have been over 600 million downloads from the PlayStation Store worldwide . The PlayStation Store is updated with new content each Tuesday in North America , and each Wednesday in PAL regions . In May 2010 this was changed from Thursdays to allow PSP games to be released digitally , closer to the time they are released on UMD . What 's new What 's New was announced at Gamescom 2009 and was released on September 1 , 2009 , with PlayStation 3 system software 3.0 . The feature was to replace the existing ( Information Board ) , which displayed news from the PlayStation website associated with the user 's region . The concept was developed further into a major PlayStation Network feature , which interacts with the ( Status Indicator ) to display a ticker of all content , excluding recently played content ( currently in North America and Japan only ) . The system displays the What 's New screen by default instead of the ( Games ) menu ( or ( Video ) menu , if a movie was inserted ) when starting up . What 's New has four sections : `` Our Pick '' , `` Recently Played '' , latest information and new content available in PlayStation Store . There are four kinds of content the What 's New screen displays and links to , on the sections . `` Recently Played '' displays the user 's recently played games and online services only , whereas , the other sections can contain website links , links to play videos and access to selected sections of the PlayStation Store . The PlayStation Store icons in the ( Game ) and ( Video ) section act similarly to the What 's New screen , except that they only display and link to games and videos in the PlayStation Store , respectively . PlayStation Home Main article : PlayStation Home PlayStation Home was a virtual 3D social networking service for the PlayStation Network . Home allowed users to create a custom avatar , which could be groomed realistically . Users could edit and decorate their personal apartments , avatars , or club houses with free , premium , or won content . Users could shop for new items or win prizes from PS3 games , or Home activities . Users could interact and connect with friends and customize content in a virtual world . Home also acted as a meeting place for users that wanted to play multiplayer games with others . A closed beta began in Europe from May 2007 and expanded to other territories soon after . Home was delayed and expanded several times before initially releasing . The Open Beta test was started on December 11 , 2008 . It remained as a perpetual beta until its closure on March 31 , 2015 . Home was available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar . Membership was free , but required a PSN account . Home featured places to meet and interact , dedicated game spaces , developer spaces , company spaces , and events . The service underwent a weekly maintenance and frequent updates . At the time of its closure in March 2015 , Home had been downloaded by 41 million users . Life with PlayStation The Life with PlayStation application showing weather forecasts and news headlines for New York City . Screenshot taken at approximately 8pm PST . Main article : Life with PlayStation Life with PlayStation , released on September 18 , 2008 to succeed Folding@home , was retired November 6 , 2012 . Life with PlayStation used virtual globe data to display news and information by city . Along with Folding@home functionality , the application provided access to three other information `` channels '' , the first being the Live Channel offering news headlines and weather which were provided by Google News , The Weather Channel , the University of Wisconsin -- Madison Space Science and Engineering Center , among other sources . The second channel was the World Heritage channel which offered historical information about historical sites . The third channel was the United Village channel . United Village was designed to share information about communities and cultures worldwide . An update allowed video and photo viewing in the application . The fourth channel was the U.S. exclusive PlayStation Network Game Trailers Channel for direct streaming of game trailers . Outage Main article : 2011 PlayStation Network outage On April 20 , 2011 , Sony shut down the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a prolonged interval , revealing on April 23 that this was due to `` an external intrusion on our system '' . Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken , including : names ; addresses ; countries ; email addresses ; birthdates ; PSN \/ Qriocity logins , passwords and handles \/ PSN online IDs . It also stated that it was possible that users ' profile data , including purchase history and billing address , and PlayStation Network \/ Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained . There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken , but the possibility could not be ruled out , and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained . Additionally , the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number from the back of the credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions . In response to the incident , Sony announced a `` Welcome Back '' program , 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members , two free downloadable PS3 games , and a free one - year enrollment in an identity theft protection program . Sales and production costs Region units sold First available Canada `` about 1.5 million '' as of October 6 , 2010 November 17 , 2006 Europe ( Includes UK and other PAL regions ) 30 million as of December 19 , 2012 March 23 , 2007 Japan 6,341,950 as of April 1 , 2011 November 11 , 2006 United Kingdom 5 million as of October 11 , 2012 March 23 , 2007 United States 13.5 million as of November 11 , 2010 November 17 , 2006 Worldwide 80 million ( as of November 2 , 2013 ) November 11 , 2006 ( details ) Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony , PlayStation 3 had an inauspicious start , and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes . The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation 's most successful console in terms of units sold . Furthermore , PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start , and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the Grand Theft Auto and Final Fantasy series ( regarding cross-platform games , Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006 , although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed ) , and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360 . Sony also continued to lose money on each PS3 sold through 2010 , although the redesigned `` slim '' PS3 has cut these losses since then . PlayStation 3 's initial production cost is estimated by iSuppli to have been US $ 805.85 for the 20 GB model and US $840.35 for the 60 GB model . However , they were priced at US $499 and US $599 respectively , meaning that units may have been sold at an estimated loss of $306 or $241 depending on model , if the cost estimates were correct , and thus may have contributed to Sony 's games division posting an operating loss of \u00a5 232.3 billion ( US $1.97 billion ) in the fiscal year ending March 2007 . In April 2007 , soon after these results were published , Ken Kutaragi , President of Sony Computer Entertainment , announced plans to retire . Various news agencies , including The Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that this was due to poor sales , while SCEI maintains that Kutaragi had been planning his retirement for six months prior to the announcement . In January 2008 , Kaz Hirai , CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment , suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009 , stating that , `` the next fiscal year starts in April and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing '' and that `` ( profitability ) is not a definite commitment , but that is what I would like to try to shoot for '' . However , market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008 . In a July 2008 interview , Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year , surpassing PlayStation 2 's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market . In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008 . Since the system 's launch , production costs have been reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the Emotion Engine chip and falling hardware costs . The cost of manufacturing Cell microprocessors has fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process , and Blu - ray Disc diodes have become cheaper to manufacture . As of January 2008 , each unit cost around $400 to manufacture ; by August 2009 , Sony had reduced costs by a total of 70 % , meaning it only costs Sony around $240 per unit . Critical reception Early PlayStation 3 reviews after launch were critical of its high price and lack of quality games . Game developers regarded the architecture as difficult to program for . PS3 was , however , commended for its hardware including its Blu - ray home theater capabilities and graphics potential . Critical and commercial reception to PS3 improved over time , after a series of price revisions , Blu - ray 's victory over HD DVD , and the release of several well received titles . Ars Technica 's original launch review gave PS3 only a 6 \/ 10 , but second review of the console in June 2008 rated it a 9 \/ 10 . In September 2009 , IGN named PlayStation 3 the 15th best gaming console of all time , behind both of its competitors : Wii ( 10th ) and Xbox 360 ( 6th ) . However , PS3 has won IGN 's `` Console Showdown '' -- based on which console offers the best selection of games released during each year -- in three of the four years since it began ( 2008 , 2009 and 2011 , with Xbox winning in 2010 ) . IGN judged PlayStation 3 to have the best game line - up of 2008 , based on their review scores in comparison to those of Wii and Xbox 360 . In a comparison piece by PC Magazine 's Will Greenwald in June 2012 , PS3 was selected as an overall better console compared to Xbox 360 . Pocket - lint said of the console `` The PS3 has always been a brilliant games console , '' and that `` For now , this is just about the best media device for the money . '' Original model PS3 was given the number - eight spot on PC World magazine 's list of `` The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006 '' , where it was criticized for being `` Late , Expensive and Incompatible '' . GamesRadar ranked PS3 as the top item in a feature on game - related PR disasters , asking how Sony managed to `` take one of the most anticipated game systems of all time and -- within the space of a year -- turn it into a hate object reviled by the entire internet '' , but added that despite its problems the system has `` untapped potential '' . Business Week summed up the general opinion by stating that it was `` more impressed with what ( the PlayStation 3 ) could do than with what it currently does '' . Developers also found the machine difficult to program for . In 2007 , Gabe Newell of Valve said `` The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels , I think it 's really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted '' . He continued `` I 'd say , even at this late date , they should just cancel it and do a do over . Just say , ' This was a horrible disaster and we 're sorry and we 're going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it ' '' . Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects . He later restated Valve 's position , `` Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together , until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that , I do n't really see us moving to that platform '' . At Sony 's E3 2010 press conference , Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements , citing Sony 's move to make the system more developer friendly , and to announce that Valve would be developing Portal 2 for the system . He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks ( Valve 's system to automatically update their software independently ) would help to make the PS3 version of Portal 2 the best console version on the market . Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has criticized PS3 's high development costs and inferior attach rate and return to that of Xbox 360 and Wii . He believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console . In an interview with The Times Kotick stated `` I 'm getting concerned about Sony ; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they do n't make it easy for me to support the platform . '' He continued , `` It 's expensive to develop for the console , and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better . Games generate a better return on invested capital ( ROIC ) on the Xbox than on the PlayStation . '' Kotick also claimed that Activision Blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed . `` ( Sony has ) to cut the ( PS3 's retail ) price , because if they do n't , the attach rates are likely to slow . If we are being realistic , we might have to stop supporting Sony . '' Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement , notably from developer BioWare who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move , and referred to the statement as `` silly . '' Despite the initial negative press , several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware . CNET United Kingdom praised the system saying , `` the PS3 is a versatile and impressive piece of home - entertainment equipment that lives up to the hype ( ... ) the PS3 is well worth its hefty price tag . '' CNET awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10 and voted it as its number one `` must - have '' gadget , praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games . In addition , both Home Theater Magazine and Ultimate AV have given the system 's Blu - ray playback very favorable reviews , stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone Blu - ray Disc players . In an interview , Kazuo Hirai , chairman of Sony Computer Entertainment argued for the choice of a complex architecture . Hexus Gaming reviewed the PAL version and summed the review up by saying , `` as the PlayStation 3 matures and developers start really pushing it , we 'll see the PlayStation 3 emerge as the console of choice for gaming . '' At GDC 2007 , Shiny Entertainment founder Dave Perry stated , `` I think that Sony has made the best machine . It 's the best piece of hardware , without question '' . Slim model and rebranding The PlayStation 3 Slim received extremely positive reviews as well as a boost in sales ; less than 24 hours after its announcement , PS3 Slim took the number - one bestseller spot on Amazon.com in the video games section for fifteen consecutive days . It regained the number - one position again one day later . PS3 Slim also received praise from PC World giving it a 90 out of 100 praising its new repackaging and the new value it brings at a lower price as well as praising its quietness and the reduction in its power consumption . This is in stark contrast to the original PS3 's launch in which it was given position number - eight on their `` The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006 '' list . CNET awarded PS3 Slim four out of five stars praising its Blu - ray capabilities , 120 GB hard drive , free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point , but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for PlayStation 2 games . TechRadar gave PS3 Slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating `` Over all , the PS3 Slim is a phenomenal piece of kit . It 's amazing that something so small can do so much '' . However , they criticized the exterior design and the build quality in relation to the original model . Eurogamer called it `` a product where the cost - cutting has -- by and large -- been tastefully done '' and said `` It 's nothing short of a massive win for Sony . '' Super Slim model The Super Slim model of PS3 has received positive reviews . Gaming website Spong praised the new Super Slim 's quietness , stating `` The most noticeable noise comes when the drive seeks a new area of the disc , such as when starting to load a game , and this occurs infrequently . '' They added that the fans are quieter than that of Slim , and went on to praise the new smaller , lighter size . Criticism was placed on the new disc loader , stating : `` The cover can be moved by hand if you wish , there 's also an eject button to do the work for you , but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar ( XMB ) interface . In addition , you have to close the cover by hand , which can be a bit fiddly if it 's upright , and the PS3 wo n't start reading a disc unless you do ( close the cover ) . '' They also said there is no real drop in retail price . Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars ( `` Excellent '' ) , saying `` The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors : a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services ( ... ) '' , whilst also criticising the `` cheap '' design and disc - loader , stating : `` Sometimes ( the cover ) does n't catch and you feel like you 're using one of those old credit card imprinter machines . In short , it feels cheap . You do n't realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they 're gone . Whether it was to cut costs or save space , this move is ultimately a step back . '' The criticism also was due to price , stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model , and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive should n't be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced . They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is `` the easiest yet . Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay , which can quickly be unscrewed . '' They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade , it could be an indicator as to what 's to come . `` It may not be revolutionary , but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package . There does n't seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade , but for the prospective PS3 buyer , the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot - loading disc drive . '' Pocket - Lint gave Super Slim a very positive review saying `` It 's much more affordable , brilliant gaming , second - to - none video and media player . '' They think it is `` A blinding good console and one that will serve you for years to come with second - hand games and even new releases . Without doubt , if you do n't have a PS3 , this is the time to buy . '' They gave Super Slim 4 and a half stars out of 5 . Technology magazine T3 gave the Super Slim model a positive review , stating the console is almost `` nostalgic '' in the design similarities to the original `` fat '' model , `` While we do n't know whether it will play PS3 games or Blu - ray discs any differently yet , the look and feel of the new PS3 Slim is an obvious homage to the original PS3 , minus the considerable excess weight . Immediately we would be concerned about the durability of the top loading tray that feels like it could be yanked straight out off the console , but ultimately it all feels like Sony 's nostalgic way of signing off the current generation console in anticipation for the PS4 .

{"document_plaintext":"Subsistence agriculture - wikipedia Subsistence agriculture Like most farmers in Africa , this Cameroonian man cultivates at the subsistence level . Subsistence agriculture is a self - sufficiency farming system in which the farmers focus on growing enough food to feed themselves and their entire families . The output is mostly for local requirements with little or no surplus trade . The typical subsistence farm has a range of crops and animals needed by the family to feed and clothe themselves during the year . Planting decisions are made principally with an eye toward what the family will need during the coming year , and secondarily toward market prices . Tony Waters writes : `` Subsistence peasants are people who grow what they eat , build their own houses , and live without regularly making purchases in the marketplace . '' However , despite the primacy of self - sufficiency in subsistence farming , today most subsistence farmers also participate in trade to some degree , though usually it is for goods that are not necessary for survival , and may include sugar , iron roofing sheets , bicycles , used clothing , and so forth . Most subsistence farmers today reside in developing countries , although their amount of trade as measured in cash is less than that of consumers in countries with modern complex markets , many have important trade contacts and trade items that they can produce because of their special skills or special access to resources valued in the marketplace . Subsistence agriculture also emerged independently in Mexico where it was based on maize cultivation , and the Andes where it was based on the domestication of the potato . Subsistence agriculture was the dominant mode of production in the world until recently , when market - based capitalism became widespread . Subsistence horticulture may have developed independently in South East Asia and Papua New Guinea . Subsistence farming continues today in large parts of rural Africa , and parts of Asia and Latin America . In 2015 , about 2 billion people ( slightly more than 25 % of the world 's population ) in 500 million households living in rural areas of developing nations survive as `` smallholder '' farmers , working less than 2 hectares ( 5 acres ) of land . Subsistence agriculture had largely disappeared in Europe by the beginning of World War I , and in North America with the movement of sharecroppers and tenant farmers out of the American South and Midwest during the 1930s and 1940s . As recently as the 1950s , it was still common on family farms in North America and Europe to grow much of a family 's own food and make much of its own clothing , although sales of some of the farm 's production earned enough currency to buy certain staples , typically including sugar ; coffee and tea ; petroleum distillates ( petrol , kerosene , fuel oil ) ; textile products such as bolts of cloth , needles , and thread ; medicines ; hardware products such as nails , screws , and wire ; and a few discretionary items such as candy or books . Many of the preceding items , as well as occasional services from physicians , veterinarians , blacksmiths , and others , were often bought with barter rather than currency . In Central and Eastern Europe subsistence and semi-subsistence agriculture reappeared within the transition economy since about 1990 .

After 2 - 3 years the fertility of the soil begins to decline , the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to clear a fresh piece of land elsewhere in the forest as the process continues . While the land is left fallow the forest regrows in the cleared area and soil fertility and biomass is restored . After a decade or more , the farmer may return to the first piece of land . This form of agriculture is sustainable at low population densities , but higher population loads require more frequent clearing which prevents soil fertility from recovering , opens up more of the forest canopy , and encourages scrub at the expense of large trees , eventually resulting in deforestation and land erosion . Shifting cultivation is called Dredd in India , Ladang in Indonesia , Milpa in Central America and Mexico and Jhumming in North East India . Primitive agriculture ( edit ) While this ' slash - and - burn ' technique may describe the method for opening new land , commonly the farmers in question have in existence at the same time smaller fields , sometimes merely gardens , near the homestead there they practice intensive ' non-shifting '' techniques until shortage of fields where they can employ `` slash and burn '' to clear land and ( by the burning ) provide fertilizer ( ash ) . Such gardens nearer the homestead often regularly receive household refuse , the manure of any household chickens or goats , and compost piles where refuse is thrown initially just to get it out of the way . However , such farmers often recognize the value of such compost and apply it regularly to their smaller fields . They also may irrigate part of such fields if they are near a source of water . In some areas of tropical Africa , at least , such smaller fields may be ones in which crops are grown on raised beds . Thus farmers practicing ' slash and burn ' agriculture are often much more sophisticated agriculturalists than the term `` slash and burn '' subsistence farmers suggest . Nomadic herding ( edit ) In this type of farming people migrate along with their animals from one place to another in search of fodder for their animals . Generally they rear cattle , sheep , goats , camels and \/ or yaks for milk , skin , meat and wool . This way of life is common in parts of central and western Asia , India , east and south - west Africa and northern Eurasia . Examples are the nomadic Bhotiyas and Gujjars of the Himalayas . They carry their belongings , such as tents , etc ... , on the backs of donkeys , horses , and camels . In mountainous regions , like Tibet and The Andes , Yak and Llama are reared . Reindeer are the livestock in arctic and sub-arctic areas . Sheep , goats , and camels are common animals , and cattle and horses are also important ... Intensive subsistence farming ( edit ) In intensive subsistence agriculture , the farmer cultivates a small plot of land using simple tools and more labour . Climate , with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot . Farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough , for their local consumption , while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods . It results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns . In the most intensive situation , farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies . Such fields are found in densely populated parts of Asia , such as in The Philippines . They may also intensify by using manure , artificial irrigation and animal waste as fertilizer . Intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south , southwest , and east Asia . Poverty alleviation ( edit ) Subsistence agriculture can be used as a poverty alleviation strategy , specifically as a safety net for food - price shocks and for food security . Poor countries are limited in fiscal and institutional resources that would allow them to contain rises in domestic prices as well as to manage social assistance programs , which is often because they are using policy tools that are intended for middle - and high - income countries . Low - income countries tend to have populations in which 80 % of poor are in rural areas and more than 90 % of rural households have access to land , yet a majority of these rural poor have insufficient access to food . Subsistence agriculture can be used in low - income countries as a part of policy responses to a food crisis in the short and medium term , and provide a safety net for the poor in these countries .

{"document_plaintext":"Fire triangle - wikipedia Fire triangle This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( November 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The Fire Triangle . The Fire Triangle or Combustion Triangle or '' Fire Diamond '' are simple models for understanding the necessary ingredients for most fires . The triangle illustrates the three elements a fire needs to ignite : heat , fuel , and an oxidizing agent ( usually oxygen ) . A fire naturally occurs when the elements are present and combined in the right mixture , meaning that fire is actually an event rather than a thing . A fire can be prevented or extinguished by removing any one of the elements in the fire triangle . For example , covering a fire with a fire blanket removes the oxygen part of the triangle and can extinguish a fire . In large fires where firefighters are called in , decreasing the amount of oxygen is not usually an option because there is no effective way to make that happen in an extended area . Contents ( hide ) 1 Fire Tetrahedron 2 Oxidizer 3 Extinction of the fire 4 Role of water in fire - fighting 5 Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires 6 See also 7 Notes 8 References Fire tetrahedron ( edit ) Not to be confused with NFPA 704 , also called the fire diamond . The fire tetrahedron The fire tetrahedron represents the addition of a component in the chemical chain reaction , to the three already present in the fire triangle . Once a fire has started , the resulting exothermic chain reaction sustains the fire and allows it to continue until or unless at least one of the elements of the fire is blocked . Foam can be used to deny the fire the oxygen it needs . Water can be used to lower the temperature of the fuel below the ignition point or to remove or disperse the fuel . Halon can be used to remove free radicals and create a barrier of inert gas in a direct attack on the chemical reaction responsible for the fire . Combustion is the chemical reaction that feeds a fire more heat and allows it to continue . When the fire involves burning metals like lithium , magnesium , titanium , etc. ( known as a class - D fire ) , it becomes even more important to consider the energy release . The metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is released . Putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even exploding . Carbon dioxide extinguishers are ineffective against certain metals such as titanium . Therefore , inert agents ( e.g. dry sand ) must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion . In the same way , as soon as one of the four elements of the tetrahedron is removed , combustion stops . Oxidizer ( edit ) The oxidizer is the other reactant of the chemical reaction . In most cases , it is the ambient air , and in particular one of its components , oxygen ( O ) . By depriving a fire of air , it can be extinguished ; for example , when covering the flame of a small candle with an empty glass , fire stops ; to the contrary , if air is blown over a wood fire with bellows , the fire is activated by the introduction of more air . In certain torches , gaseous oxygen is introduced to improve combustion . Some chemicals , such as fluorine gas , perchlorate salts such as ammonium perchlorate , or chlorine trifluoride , act as oxidisers , sometimes more powerful ones than oxygen itself . A fire based on a reaction with these oxidisers can be very difficult to put out until the oxidiser is exhausted ; that leg of the fire triangle can not be broken by normal means ( i.e. , depriving it of air will not smother it ) . In certain cases such as some explosives , the oxidizer and combustible are the same ( e.g. , nitroglycerin , an unstable molecule that has oxidizing parts in the same molecule as the oxidizeable parts ) . Reaction is initiated by an activating energy , in most cases , it is heat . Several examples include friction , as in case of matches , heating an electrical wire , a flame ( propagation of fire ) , or a spark ( from a lighter or from any starting electrical device ) . There are also many other ways to bring sufficient activation energy including electricity , radiation , and pressure , all of which will lead to a temperature rise . In most cases , heat production enables self - sustainability of the reaction , and enables a chain reaction to grow . The temperature at which a liquid produces sufficient vapor to get a flammable mix with self - sustainable combustion is called its flash - point . Extinction of the fire ( edit ) To stop a combustion reaction , one of the three elements of the fire - triangle has to be removed . Without sufficient heat , a fire can not begin , and it can not continue . Heat can be removed by the application of a substance which reduces the amount of heat available to the fire reaction . This is often water , which absorbs heat for phase change from water to steam . Introducing sufficient quantities and types of powder or gas in the flame reduces the amount of heat available for the fire reaction in the same manner . Scraping embers from a burning structure also removes the heat source . Turning off the electricity in an electrical fire removes the ignition source . Without fuel , a fire will stop . Fuel can be removed naturally , as where the fire has consumed all the burnable fuel , or manually , by mechanically or chemically removing the fuel from the fire . Fuel separation is an important factor in wildland fire suppression , and is the basis for most major tactics , such as controlled burns . The fire stops because a lower concentration of fuel vapor in the flame leads to a decrease in energy release and a lower temperature . Removing the fuel thereby decreases the heat . Without sufficient oxygen , a fire can not begin , and it can not continue . With a decreased oxygen concentration , the combustion process slows . Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher , a fire blanket or water . Role of water in fire - fighting ( edit ) Water can have two different roles . In the case of a solid combustible , the solid fuel produce pyrolyzing products under the influence of heat , commonly radiation . This process is halted by the application of water , since water is more easily evaporated than the fuel is pyrolyzed . Thereby energy is removed from the fuel surface and it is cooled and the pyrolysis is stopped , removing the fuel supply to the flames . In fire fighting , this is referred to as surface cooling . In the gas phase , i.e. in the flames or in the smoke , the combustible can not be separated from the oxidizer , and the only possible action consists of cooling down . In this case , water droplets are evaporated in the gas phase , thereby lowering the temperature and adding water vapour making the gas mixture non combustible . This requires droplets of a size less than about 0.2 mm . In fire fighting , this is referred to as gas cooling or smoke cooling . Cases also exist where the ignition factor is not the activation energy . For example , a smoke explosion is a very violent combustion of unburned gases contained in the smoke created by a sudden fresh air input ( oxidizer input ) . The interval in which an air \/ gas mix can burn is limited by the explosive limits of the air . This interval can be very small ( kerosene ) or large ( acetylene ) . Water can not be used on certain type of fires : Fires where live electricity is present -- as water conducts electricity it presents an electrocution hazard . Hydrocarbon fires -- as it will only spread the fire because of the difference in density \/ hydrophobicity . For example , adding water to a fire with an oil source will cause the oil to spread , since oil and water do not mix . Metal fires -- as these fires produce huge amounts of energy ( up to 7.550 calories \/ kg for aluminium ) and water can also create violent chemical reactions with burning metal ( possibly even serving as an additional oxidizing agent ) . Since these reactions are well understood , it has been possible to create specific water - additives which will allow : A better heat absorption with a higher density than water . Carrying free radical catchers on the fire . Carrying foaming agents to enable water to stay on the surface of a liquid fire and prevent gas release . Carrying specific reactives which will react and change the nature of the burning material . Water - additives are generally designed to be effective on several categories of fires ( class A + class B or even class A + class B + class F ) , meaning a better global performance and usability of a single extinguisher on many different types of fires ( or fires that involve several different classes of materials ) . Multi-scale fire triangles for wildland fires ( edit ) Multi-scale fire triangles describing the elements of wildland fire at the scale of the flame , a wildfire , and a fire regime . Adapted from Moritz et al. ( 2005 ) Wildfire , complexity , and highly optimized tolerance . Proceedings of the National Academy of Science 102 , 17912 - 17917 . In the context of wildland fire , the fire triangle can be scaled up to apply to understand fire spread over landscapes ( scales of days and several km ) and recurrence of fire over time ( scales of decades and hundreds of km ) . Thus , while heat is important to ignite a flame , topography is important for aiding fire spread especially by preheating upslope fuels , and ignitions sources are important to help explain recurrence on longer time scales . Similarly , while oxygen is relevant to sustain a flame , weather and associated winds feed oxygen into a spreading fire , and the longer - term pattern of weather is summarized as climate . Lastly , fuels is the term to describe what burns in a single flame to the range of materials burnt in a spreading wildfire , but fuels vary over larger space and time scales in what is called vegetation . At the smallest scale , the combustion fire triangle , individual fuel particles are ignited once at a critical temperature , and fire transfers energy to the nearest surroundings . Combustion events range on the scale of several seconds to a couple of days and their effects are monitored at the quadrant scale . The largest scale , in contrast , describes the fire regime concept . Global climate change drives drives many of the factors involved in the ' wildfire ' and the ' fire regime ' triangles . For example , with respect to the fire regime , a particular vegetation type will support a characteristic fire in terms of recurrence , intensity , seasonality and biological effects ; a change in vegetation type will have implications for a changing fire regime .

AT HOP card AT HOP card Location Auckland Launched October 2012 Manager Thales Group Currency NZD Stored - value Pay as you go Validity Trains Fullers ferries Auckland buses Retailed Online Ticket offices Website http:\/\/www.athop.co.nz\/ The AT HOP card is an electronic fare payment card that was released in two versions on Auckland public transport services , beginning in May 2011 . The smart card roll out was the first phase in the introduction of an integrated ticketing and fares system ( Auckland Integrated Fares System , or `` AIFS '' ) that was rolled out across the region . The first iteration of the card -- commonly referred to as the `` purple HOP card '' -- was discontinued in 2012 because of issues with the delivery of key technologies . The current card , called the AT HOP card , is in use on all ferry , train and bus services in Auckland . The rollout of the card to all three transport modes was completed in March 2014 . Contents 1 Card operation 2 History 2.1 HOP \/ Snapper card debacle 2.2 Launch 2.3 Post-launch operation 3 See also 4 References Card operation ( edit ) The AT HOP card is a dark blue credit - card - sized stored - value contactless smartcard that can hold prepaid funds ( called HOP Money ) to pay for fares or for monthly passes for unlimited travel within one or more of three `` transport zones '' . Either facility must be added to the card before travel . Passengers `` tag on '' and `` tag off '' their card on electronic terminals when entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds . Cards may be `` topped - up '' or monthly passes purchased in the following ways : online , at ticket machines , at ticketing offices , and at selected retail outlets such as bookshops . Top ups may be made by credit or debit card , with the latter three mediums accepting cash payment . The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of paper tickets . Usage is encouraged by offering cheaper fares than the cash ticket option , although there is an initial once - only fee to purchase the card . Monthly and \/ or multiple trip travel is only available with the AT HOP card . The card can be used only for fare payments and only on Auckland Transport routes ; it can not be used to pay for refreshments or other items . It can not be used to pay for travel on the Northern Explorer passenger train running between Auckland and Wellington or on inter-city bus services . The AT HOP cards are based on near field communication ( NFC ) with DESFire with support of 3DES and AES , enabling 168 - 128 bit keys . This encryption give card holders the ability to not have their card simply cloned . History ( edit ) In 2008 , the Auckland Regional Transport Authority announced its intentions to develop an integrated ticketing system for the region 's public transport services , called the Auckland Integrated Fares System ( AIFS ) . An initial system developed with a consortium including the French Thales Group and New Zealand - based Snapper Services was announced in 2010 , however subsequent difficulties with the development of technologies for the system saw the termination of Auckland Transport 's agreement with Snapper . The council - controlled organisation confirmed Thales would be contracted with ongoing development of the system across the entirety of the region 's transport network . HOP \/ Snapper card debacle ( edit ) Snapper Services Ltd , a subsidiary of Infratil , made a joint bid with ANZ , New Zealand Post , Eyede , Unisys and Beca Group for the contract of developing Auckland 's integrated ticketing system . However , the contract was awarded to the Thales Group . Snapper lodged a complaint , later dismissed , questioning the legitimacy of the tender process . The first iteration of the HOP card supplied by Snapper could be used on NZ Bus services only . Snapper announced in late - 2009 that it would begin rolling out its Snapper card onto NZ Bus services ( but no other Auckland bus company or service ) , in spite of the Auckland Regional Transport Authority - Thales integrated ticketing arrangement . In response , the Auckland Regional Transport Authority called the Snapper announcement `` premature '' citing the development of ARTA 's integrated ticketing offering still in development with Thales and confirming that all public transport operators in Auckland , including NZ Bus , would be required to participate in ARTA 's system . Replacing the Auckland Regional Transport Authority in 2010 , Auckland Transport announced it had invited Snapper to work with the council - controlled organisation and Thales on the ticketing system . Auckland Transport confirmed Snapper would develop a contactless smart card and supply buses with ticketing terminals that would support the Thales developed back - end , to be rolled out initially on NZ Bus services and later on ferry and train services in time for the Rugby World Cup 2011 . In April 2011 , Auckland Transport announced the `` HOP card '' , developed by Snapper , with initial rollout on all NZ Bus services . This iteration of the `` HOP card '' was met with initial confusion as to its capabilities and the extent of Auckland Transport 's integration with Snapper and Snapper 's pre-existing infrastructure , which included the ability to make minor transactions with merchants and retailers . Concerns were also raised as to the ability of Auckland 's ticketing system to work with Snapper cards used on Wellington 's transport network and vice versa , with Auckland Transport later instructing NZ Bus drivers not to accept the Wellington implementation of the Snapper card . Auckland Transport subsequently announced in early - 2012 that bus passengers would be required to `` swap out '' their HOP \/ Snapper cards for a new integrated ticketing card , also called `` HOP '' , as the Snapper offering would not be supported on ferries , trains and on some bus services . Snapper faced difficulties in developing its technology to work with the Thales system , with Thales ' New Zealand chief executive citing that the `` failure of Snapper to deliver a functional bus system that meets the ratified standard has caused delays to project go - live '' . Snapper 's `` failure '' to meet the November 30 deadline imposed by Auckland Transport ultimately led to the organisation severing its relationship with Snapper , citing `` concerns about whether Snapper could modify its system in a suitable timeframe '' . Snapper maintained it was `` wrongly blamed '' for the delays , declaring `` Auckland Transport is being disingenuous with its attempt to position Snapper as the reason that the ( integrated ticketing ) project is delayed . '' Auckland Transport confirmed it had commissioned Thales to provide the new iteration of the `` HOP '' smart card -- called `` AT HOP '' -- and its ticketing terminals , replacing the HOP \/ Snapper offering on NZ Bus services and introducing the new card onto ferries , trains and all other bus services . Launch ( edit ) AT HOP pilot card The current blue ' AT HOP card ' began rolling out on public transport , starting with the rail network on 28 October 2012 . The rollout for all Auckland bus , train and ferry services was completed by March 2014 . Spark ( then Telecom ) had trialed a ' virtual AT HOP card ' on Android phones with NFC and intended it for release in late 2013 . Post-launch operation ( edit ) A fee of 25 cents for each top up was abolished in July 2014 . In September 2016 , it was reported that the one millionth AT Hop card had been sold , and that 42 per cent of Auckland adults had a card as of June ( 2016 ) .

{"document_plaintext":"Elephant in the room - wikipedia Elephant in the room For other uses , see Elephant in the room ( disambiguation ) . The Elephant in the Room , Banksy exhibition , 2006 Barely Legal show , Los Angeles ( The elephant is Tai ) Elephant in the room is an English - language metaphorical idiom for an obvious problem or risk that no one wants to discuss . It is based on the idea \/ thought that something as conspicuous as an elephant can appear to be overlooked in codified social interactions , and that the sociology \/ psychology of repression also operates on the macro scale . Contents ( hide ) 1 Origins 2 Usage 2.1 Similar 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References 6 External links Origins ( edit ) In 1814 , Ivan Andreevich Krylov ( 1769 -- 1844 ) , poet and fabulist , wrote a fable entitled `` The Inquisitive Man '' which tells of a man who goes to a museum and notices all sorts of tiny things , but fails to notice an elephant . The phrase became proverbial . Fyodor Dostoevsky in his novel ' Demons ' wrote , ' Belinsky was just like Krylov 's Inquisitive Man , who did n't notice the elephant in the museum ... ' The Oxford English Dictionary gives the first recorded use of the phrase , as a simile , in The New York Times on June 20 , 1959 : `` Financing schools has become a problem about equal to having an elephant in the living room . It 's so big you just ca n't ignore it . '' This idiomatic expression may have been in general use much earlier than 1959 . For example , the phrase appears 44 years earlier in the pages of a British journal , Journal of Education , in 1915 . The sentence was presented as a trivial illustration of a question British schoolboys would be able to answer , e.g. , `` Is there an elephant in the class - room ? '' The first widely disseminated conceptual reference was a story written by Mark Twain in 1882 , `` The Stolen White Elephant '' , which slyly dissects the inept , far - ranging activities of detectives trying to find an elephant that was right on the spot after all . This may have been the reference in the legal opinion of United States v. Leviton , 193 F. 2d 848 ( 2nd Circuit , 1951 ) , makes reference in its opinion , `` As I have elsewhere observed , it is like the Mark Twain story of the little boy who was told to stand in a corner and not to think of a white elephant . '' A slightly different version of the phrase was used before this , with George Berkeley talking of whether or not there is `` an invisible elephant in the room '' in his debates with scientists . In 1935 , comedian Jimmy Durante starred on Broadway in the Billy Rose Broadway musical Jumbo , in which a police officer stops him while leading a live elephant and asks , `` What are you doing with that elephant ? '' Durante 's reply , `` What elephant ? '' was a regular show - stopper . Durante reprises the piece in the 1962 film version of the play , Billy Rose 's Jumbo . Usage ( edit ) The term refers to a question , problem , solution , or controversial issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation , but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment , sadness , or trigger arguments or is simply taboo . The idiom can imply a value judgment that the issue ought to be discussed openly , or it can simply be an acknowledgment that the issue is there and not going to go away by itself . The term is often used to describe an issue that involves a social taboo , such as race , religion , homosexuality , mental illness , or even suicide . It is applicable when a subject is emotionally charged ; and the people who might have spoken up decide that it is probably best avoided . The idiom is commonly used in addiction recovery terminology to describe the reluctance of friends and family of an addicted person to discuss the person 's problem , thus aiding the person 's denial . Especially in reference to alcohol abuse , the idiom is sometimes coupled with that of the pink elephant , q.v. `` the pink elephant in the room . '' The expression has also been used as a metaphorical idiom in Spanish . In 1994 , the 8000 Process was a legal investigation of events surrounding accusations that the campaign of Colombian Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper for President of Colombia was partially funded with drug money from the Cali Cartel . Insisting on his innocence , Samper stated that if drug money had entered the presidential campaign , it had done so `` behind his back '' . Cardinal Pedro Rubiano , a leader of Colombia 's Catholic Church , stated in an interview that not knowing that drug money financed part of the presidential campaign was similar to not noticing `` an elephant entering one 's living room '' . Since then , the events that led to drug money financing the `` Samper for President '' campaign have been referred to as `` The Elephant '' . For some , their first encounter with this phrase comes through the poem of the same name by Terry Kettering . In one edition of Time magazine in 2013 , Chris Christie was labeled as the `` Elephant in the Room '' on the cover page . Similar ( edit ) A variation is the phrase `` elephant in the corner '' which is infrequently used to the same effect . Logician and philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein used an example of a rhinoceros in the room to show the impossibility of proving negative existential statements . `` Mokita '' is a word in the Kilivila language , which is spoken on Kiriwina , the largest of the Trobriand Islands ( near Papua New Guinea ) . It means `` truth we all know but agree not to talk about .

It was adopted on 20 February 2006 . A new constitution , ratified in December 2005 and which came into effect in February 2006 , promoted a return to a flag similar to that flown between 1963 and 1971 , with a change from a royal blue to sky blue background . Blue represents peace . Red stands for `` the blood of the country 's martyrs '' , yellow the country 's wealth ; and the star a radiant future for the country . ( subscription required ) Previous flags ( edit ) The previous flag was adopted in 2003 . It is similar to the flag used between 1960 and 1963 . The flag is based on the flag which was originally used by King Leopold 's Association Internationale Africaine and was first used in 1877 . The design was then implemented as the flag of the Congo Free State after the territory was recognized as an official possession of Leopold II at the Berlin Conference . After gaining independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960 , the same basic design was maintained . However , six stars were incorporated to symbolise the six provinces of the country at the time . This design was used only from 1960 to 1963 . This flag was reimplemented in 1997 , when the Mobutu government was overthrown and the country assumed its current designation of Democratic Republic of the Congo , with the 2003 flag only being different by using a lighter shade of blue . The flag of the first Republic of Mobutu Sese Seko became the official banner after Mobutu established his dictatorship . This flag was used from 1966 -- 1971 and consisted of the same yellow star , now made smaller , situated in the top corner of the hoist side , with a red , yellow - lined band running diagonally across the center . The red symbolized the people 's blood ; the yellow symbolized prosperity ; the blue symbolized hope ; and the star represented unity . This flag was changed when the country was renamed Zaire in 1971 . The Zaire flag was created as part of Mobutu 's attempted re-Africanization of the nation and was used officially until Mobutu 's overthrow in the First Congo War . The flag of Zaire was also used as the party flag of the Popular Movement of the Revolution .

'' ( 1960 ) `` Stuck on You '' \/ `` Fame and Fortune '' ( 1960 ) `` It 's Now or Never '' ( 1960 ) `` Are You Lonesome Tonight ? '' ( 1960 ) Music video `` It 's Now or Never '' ( audio ) on YouTube `` It 's Now or Never '' is a ballad recorded by Elvis Presley in 1960 . It is one of two popular songs based on the Italian song of Neapolitan language `` ' O Sole mio '' ( music by Eduardo di Capua ) , the other being `` There 's No Tomorrow '' , recorded by U.S. singer Tony Martin in 1949 , which inspired Presley 's version . The lyrics were written by Aaron Schroeder and Wally Gold . The single is the second best - selling single by Presley , and one of the best - selling singles of all time . It was recorded by Bill Porter at RCA Studio B in Nashville . In the late 1950s , while stationed in Germany with the U.S. Army , Presley heard Martin 's recording . According to The New York Times , quoting from the 1986 book Behind The Hits , `` he told the idea to his music publisher , Freddy Bienstock , who was visiting him in Germany ... Mr. Bienstock , who many times found songwriters for Presley , returned to his New York office , where he found songwriters , Mr. ( Aaron ) Schroeder and Wally Gold , the only people in that day . The two wrote lyrics in half an hour . Selling more than 20 million records , the song became number one in countries all around and was Presley 's best selling single ever ... a song ( they ) finished in 20 minutes to a half hour was the biggest song of ( their ) career . '' In 1960 , `` It 's Now or Never '' was a number - one record in the U.S. , spending five weeks at number one and the UK , where it spent eight weeks at the top in 1960 and an additional week at number one in 2005 as a re-issue , and numerous other countries , selling in excess of 25 million copies worldwide , Elvis Presley 's biggest international single ever . Its British release was delayed for some time because of rights issues , allowing the song to build up massive advance orders and to enter the UK Singles Chart at number one , a very rare occurrence at the time . `` It 's Now or Never '' peaked at number seven on the R&B charts . Barry White credited this song as his inspiration for changing his life and becoming a singer following his release from prison . A live version featuring `` ' O Sole mio '' is available on the 1977 live album Elvis in Concert . `` ' O Sole mio '' is sung by tenor Sherrill Nielson . In early 2005 , the song was re-released along with the other Presley singles in the UK , and again reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for the week of 5 February 2005 . The re-release held the record for the lowest selling number - one single in UK chart history until Orson 's `` No Tomorrow '' in 2006 . The song also appears in the TV mini-series Elvis .

{"document_plaintext":"Forecasting - wikipedia Forecasting Jump to : navigation , search For other uses , see Forecast . Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends . A commonplace example might be estimation of some variable of interest at some specified future date . Prediction is a similar , but more general term . Both might refer to formal statistical methods employing time series , cross-sectional or longitudinal data , or alternatively to less formal judgmental methods . Usage can differ between areas of application : for example , in hydrology the terms `` forecast '' and `` forecasting '' are sometimes reserved for estimates of values at certain specific future times , while the term `` prediction '' is used for more general estimates , such as the number of times floods will occur over a long period . Risk and uncertainty are central to forecasting and prediction ; it is generally considered good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attaching to forecasts . In any case , the data must be up to date in order for the forecast to be as accurate as possible . In some cases the data used to predict the independent variable is itself forecasted . Contents ( hide ) 1 Categories of forecasting methods 1.1 Qualitative vs. quantitative methods 1.2 Average approach 1.3 Na\u00efve approach 1.4 Drift method 1.5 Seasonal na\u00efve approach 1.6 Time series methods 1.7 Causal \/ econometric forecasting methods 1.8 Judgmental methods 1.9 Artificial intelligence methods 1.10 Other methods 2 Forecasting accuracy 3 Seasonality and cyclic behaviour 3.1 Seasonality 3.2 Cyclic behaviour 4 Applications 5 Limitations 5.1 Performance limits of fluid dynamics equations 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Categories of forecasting methods ( edit ) Qualitative vs. quantitative methods ( edit ) Qualitative forecasting techniques are subjective , based on the opinion and judgment of consumers , experts ; they are appropriate when past data are not available . They are usually applied to intermediate - or long - range decisions . Examples of qualitative forecasting methods are informed opinion and judgment , the Delphi method , market research , and historical life - cycle analogy . Quantitative forecasting models are used to forecast future data as a function of past data . They are appropriate to use when past numerical data is available and when it is reasonable to assume that some of the patterns in the data are expected to continue into the future . These methods are usually applied to short - or intermediate - range decisions . Examples of quantitative forecasting methods are last period demand , simple and weighted N - Period moving averages , simple exponential smoothing , poisson process model based forecasting and multiplicative seasonal indexes . Previous research shows that different methods may lead to different level of forecasting accuarcy . For example , GMDH neural network was found to have better forecasting performance than the classical forecasting algorithms such as Single Exponential Smooth , Double Exponential Smooth , ARIMA and back - propagation neural network . Average approach ( edit ) In this approach , the predictions of all future values are equal to the mean of the past data . This approach can be used with any sort of data where past data is available . In time series notation : y ^ T + h T = y  \u0304 = ( y 1 + ... + y T ) \/ T ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ hat ( y ) ) _ ( T + h T ) = ( \\ bar ( y ) ) = ( y_ ( 1 ) + ... + y_ ( T ) ) \/ T ) where y 1 , ... , y T ( \\ displaystyle y_ ( 1 ) , ... , y_ ( T ) ) is the past data . Although the time series notation has been used here , the average approach can also be used for cross-sectional data ( when we are predicting unobserved values ; values that are not included in the data set ) . Then , the prediction for unobserved values is the average of the observed values . Na\u00efve approach ( edit ) Na\u00efve forecasts are the most cost - effective forecasting model , and provide a benchmark against which more sophisticated models can be compared . This forecasting method is only suitable for time series data . Using the na\u00efve approach , forecasts are produced that are equal to the last observed value . This method works quite well for economic and financial time series , which often have patterns that are difficult to reliably and accurately predict . If the time series is believed to have seasonality , seasonal na\u00efve approach may be more appropriate where the forecasts are equal to the value from last season . The na\u00efve method may also use a drift , which will take the last observation plus the average change from the first observation to the last observation . In time series notation : y ^ T + h T = y T ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ hat ( y ) ) _ ( T + h T ) = y_ ( T ) ) Drift method ( edit ) A variation on the na\u00efve method is to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time , where the amount of change over time ( called the drift ) is set to be the average change seen in the historical data . So the forecast for time T + h ( \\ displaystyle T + h ) is given by y ^ T + h T = y T + h T \u2212 1 \u2211 t = 2 T ( y t \u2212 y t \u2212 1 ) = y T + h ( y T \u2212 y 1 T \u2212 1 ) . ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ hat ( y ) ) _ ( T + h T ) = y_ ( T ) + ( \\ frac ( h ) ( T - 1 ) ) \\ sum _ ( t = 2 ) ^ ( T ) ( y_ ( t ) - y_ ( t - 1 ) ) = y_ ( T ) + h \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( y_ ( T ) - y_ ( 1 ) ) ( T - 1 ) ) \\ right ) . ) This is equivalent to drawing a line between the first and last observation , and extrapolating it into the future . Seasonal na\u00efve approach ( edit ) The seasonal na\u00efve method accounts for seasonality by setting each prediction to be equal to the last observed value of the same season . For example , the prediction value for all subsequent months of April will be equal to the previous value observed for April . The forecast for time T + h ( \\ displaystyle T + h ) is : y ^ T + h T = y T + h \u2212 k m ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ hat ( y ) ) _ ( T + h T ) = y_ ( T + h - km ) ) where m ( \\ displaystyle m ) = seasonal period and k ( \\ displaystyle k ) is the smallest integer greater than ( h \u2212 1 ) \/ m ( \\ displaystyle ( h - 1 ) \/ m ) . The seasonal na\u00efve method is particularly useful for data that has a very high level of seasonality . Time series methods ( edit ) Time series methods use historical data as the basis of estimating future outcomes . Moving average Weighted moving average Kalman filtering Exponential smoothing Autoregressive moving average ( ARMA ) Autoregressive integrated moving average ( ARIMA ) e.g. Box -- Jenkins Seasonal ARIMA or SARIMA or ARIMARCH , Extrapolation Linear prediction Trend estimation Growth curve ( statistics ) Causal \/ econometric forecasting methods ( edit ) Some forecasting methods try to identify the underlying factors that might influence the variable that is being forecast . For example , including information about climate patterns might improve the ability of a model to predict umbrella sales . Forecasting models often take account of regular seasonal variations . In addition to climate , such variations can also be due to holidays and customs : for example , one might predict that sales of college football apparel will be higher during the football season than during the off season . Several informal methods used in causal forecasting do not employ strict algorithms , but instead use the judgment of the forecaster . Some forecasts take account of past relationships between variables : if one variable has , for example , been approximately linearly related to another for a long period of time , it may be appropriate to extrapolate such a relationship into the future , without necessarily understanding the reasons for the relationship . Causal methods include : Regression analysis includes a large group of methods for predicting future values of a variable using information about other variables . These methods include both parametric ( linear or non-linear ) and non-parametric techniques . Autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs ( ARMAX ) Quantitative forecasting models are often judged against each other by comparing their in - sample or out - of - sample mean square error , although some researchers have advised against this . Different forecasting approach has different level of accuracy . For example , it was found that GMDH has higher forecasting accuracy than traditional ARIMA Judgmental methods ( edit ) Judgmental forecasting methods incorporate intuitive judgement , opinions and subjective probability estimates . Judgmental forecasting is used in cases where there is lack of historical data or during completely new and unique market conditions . Judgmental methods include : Composite forecasts Cooke 's method Delphi method Forecast by analogy Scenario building Statistical surveys Technology forecasting Artificial intelligence methods ( edit ) Artificial neural networks Group method of data handling Support vector machines Often these are done today by specialized programs loosely labeled Data mining Machine Learning Pattern Recognition Other methods ( edit ) Simulation Prediction market Probabilistic forecasting and Ensemble forecasting Forecasting accuracy ( edit ) The forecast error ( also known as a residual ) is the difference between the actual value and the forecast value for the corresponding period . E t = Y t \u2212 F t ( \\ displaystyle \\ E_ ( t ) = Y_ ( t ) - F_ ( t ) ) where E is the forecast error at period t , Y is the actual value at period t , and F is the forecast for period t . A good forecasting method will yield residuals that are uncorrelated and have zero mean . If there are correlations between residual values , then there is information left in the residuals which should be used in computing forecasts . If the residuals have a mean other than zero , then the forecasts are biased . Measures of aggregate error : Scaled Errors : The forecast error , E , is on the same scale as the data , as such , these accuracy measures are scale - dependent and can not be used to make comparisons between series on different scales . Mean absolute error ( MAE ) or mean absolute deviation ( MAD ) M A E = \u2211 t = 1 N E t N ( \\ displaystyle \\ MAE = ( \\ frac ( \\ sum _ ( t = 1 ) ^ ( N ) E_ ( t ) ) ( N ) ) ) M A D = \u2211 t = 1 N E t N ( \\ displaystyle \\ MAD = ( \\ frac ( \\ sum _ ( t = 1 ) ^ ( N ) E_ ( t ) ) ( N ) ) ) Mean squared error ( MSE ) or mean squared prediction error ( MSPE ) M S E = \u2211 t = 1 N E t 2 N ( \\ displaystyle \\ MSE = ( \\ frac ( \\ sum _ ( t = 1 ) ^ ( N ) ( E_ ( t ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) ( N ) ) ) Root mean squared error ( RMSE ) R M S E = \u2211 t = 1 N E t 2 N ( \\ displaystyle \\ RMSE = ( \\ sqrt ( \\ frac ( \\ sum _ ( t = 1 ) ^ ( N ) ( E_ ( t ) ^ ( 2 ) ) ) ( N ) ) ) ) Average of Errors ( E ) E  \u0304 = \u2211 i = 1 N E i N ( \\ displaystyle \\ ( \\ bar ( E ) ) = ( \\ frac ( \\ sum _ ( i = 1 ) ^ ( N ) ( E_ ( i ) ) ) ( N ) ) ) Percentage Errors : These are more frequently used to compare forecast performance between different data sets because they are scale - independent . However , they have the disadvantage of being infinite or undefined if Y is close to or equal to zero . Mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE ) or mean absolute percentage deviation ( MAPD ) M A P E = 100 \u2217 \u2211 t = 1 N E t Y t N ( \\ displaystyle \\ MAPE = 100 * ( \\ frac ( \\ sum _ ( t = 1 ) ^ ( N ) ( \\ frac ( E_ ( t ) ) ( Y_ ( t ) ) ) ) ( N ) ) ) M A P D = \u2211 t = 1 N E t \u2211 t = 1 N Y t ( \\ displaystyle \\ MAPD = ( \\ frac ( \\ sum _ ( t = 1 ) ^ ( N ) E_ ( t ) ) ( \\ sum _ ( t = 1 ) ^ ( N ) Y_ ( t ) ) ) ) Scaled Errors : Hyndman and Koehler ( 2006 ) proposed using scaled errors as an alternative to percentage errors .

They refer to the PMAD as the MAPE , although they compute this as a volume weighted MAPE . For more information see Calculating demand forecast accuracy . When comparing the accuracy of different forecasting methods on a specific data set , the measures of aggregate error are compared with each other and the method that yields the lowest error is preferred . Training and test sets It is important to evaluate forecast accuracy using genuine forecasts . That is , it is invalid to look at how well a model fits the historical data ; the accuracy of forecasts can only be determined by considering how well a model performs on new data that were not used when fitting the model . When choosing models , it is common to use a portion of the available data for fitting , and use the rest of the data for testing the model , as was done in the above examples . Cross Validation A more sophisticated version of training \/ test set . for cross sectional data , cross-validation works as follows : Select observation i for the test set , and use the remaining observations in the training set . Compute the error on the test observation . Repeat the above step for i = 1 , 2 , ... , N where N is the total number of observations . Compute the forecast accuracy measures based on the errors obtained . This is a much more efficient use of the available data , as you only omit one observation at each step for time series data , the training set can only include observations prior to the test set . therefore no future observations can be used in constructing the forecast . Suppose k observations are needed to produce a reliable forecast then the process works as : Select the observation k + i for test set , and use the observations at times 1 , 2 , ... , k + i - 1 to estimate the forecasting model . Compute the error on the forecast for k + i . Repeat the above step for i = 1 , 2 , ... , T-k where T is the total number of observations . Compute the forecast accuracy over all errors This procedure is sometimes known as a `` rolling forecasting origin '' because the `` origin '' ( k + i - 1 ) at which the forecast is based rolls forward in time Limitations of Errors The two most popular measures of accuracy that incorporate the forecast error are the Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) and the Root Mean Squared Error ( RMSE ) . Thus these measures are considered to be scale - dependent , that is , they are on the same scale as the original data . Consequently , these can not be used to compare models of differing scales . Percentage errors are simply forecast errors converted into percentages and are given by P t = 100 E t \/ Y t ( \\ displaystyle P_ ( t ) = 100E_ ( t ) \/ Y_ ( t ) ) . A common accuracy measure that utilizes this is the Mean Absolute Percentage Error ( MAPE ) . This allows for comparison between data on different scales . However , percentage errors are not quite meaningful when Y t ( \\ displaystyle Y_ ( t ) ) is close to or equal to zero , which results in extreme values or simply being undefined . Scaled errors are a helpful alternative to percentage errors when comparing between different scales . They do not have the shortfall of giving unhelpful values if Y t ( \\ displaystyle Y_ ( t ) ) is close to or equal to zero . See also Calculating demand forecast accuracy Consensus forecasts Forecast error Predictability Prediction intervals , similar to confidence intervals Reference class forecasting Seasonality and cyclic behaviour ( edit ) Seasonality ( edit ) Main article : Seasonality Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year . Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one - year period can be said to be seasonal . It is common in many situations -- such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner 's office -- that the demand depends on the day of the week . In such situations , the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons . An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average ; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average . Cyclic behaviour ( edit ) The cyclic behaviour of data takes place when there are regular fluctuations in the data which usually last for an interval of at least two years , and when the length of the current cycle can not be predetermined . Cyclic behavior is not to be confused with seasonal behavior . Seasonal fluctuations follow a consistent pattern each year so the period is always known . As an example , during the Christmas period , inventories of stores tend to increase in order to prepare for Christmas shoppers . As an example of cyclic behaviour , the population of a particular natural ecosystem will exhibit cyclic behaviour when the population increases as its natural food source decreases , and once the population is low , the food source will recover and the population will start to increase again . Cyclic data can not be accounted for using ordinary seasonal adjustment since it is not of fixed period . Applications ( edit ) Forecasting has applications in a wide range of fields where estimates of future conditions are useful . Not everything can be forecasted reliably , if the factors that relate to what is being forecast are known and well understood and there is a significant amount of data that can be used very reliable forecasts can often be obtained . If this is not the case or if the actual outcome is effected by the forecasts , the reliability of the forecasts can be significantly lower . Climate change and increasing energy prices have led to the use of Egain Forecasting for buildings . This attempts to reduce the energy needed to heat the building , thus reducing the emission of greenhouse gases . Forecasting is used in Customer Demand Planning in everyday business for manufacturing and distribution companies . While the veracity of predictions for actual stock returns are disputed through reference to the Efficient - market hypothesis , forecasting of broad economic trends is common . Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for - profit private institutions ( including brokerage houses and consulting companies ) . Forecasting foreign exchange movements is typically achieved through a combination of chart and fundamental analysis . An essential difference between chart analysis and fundamental economic analysis is that chartists study only the price action of a market , whereas fundamentalists attempt to look to the reasons behind the action . Financial institutions assimilate the evidence provided by their fundamental and chartist researchers into one note to provide a final projection on the currency in question . Forecasting has also been used to predict the development of conflict situations . Forecasters perform research that uses empirical results to gauge the effectiveness of certain forecasting models . However research has shown that there is little difference between the accuracy of the forecasts of experts knowledgeable in the conflict situation and those by individuals who knew much less . Similarly , experts in some studies argue that role thinking does not contribute to the accuracy of the forecast . The discipline of demand planning , also sometimes referred to as supply chain forecasting , embraces both statistical forecasting and a consensus process . An important , albeit often ignored aspect of forecasting , is the relationship it holds with planning . Forecasting can be described as predicting what the future will look like , whereas planning predicts what the future should look like . There is no single right forecasting method to use . Selection of a method should be based on your objectives and your conditions ( data etc . ) . A good place to find a method , is by visiting a selection tree . An example of a selection tree can be found here . Forecasting has application in many situations : Supply chain management - Forecasting can be used in supply chain management to ensure that the right product is at the right place at the right time . Accurate forecasting will help retailers reduce excess inventory and thus increase profit margin . Studies have shown that extrapolations are the least accurate , while company earnings forecasts are the most reliable . Accurate forecasting will also help them meet consumer demand . Economic forecasting Earthquake prediction Egain forecasting Finance against risk of default via credit ratings and credit scores Land use forecasting Player and team performance in sports Political forecasting Product forecasting Sales forecasting Technology forecasting Telecommunications forecasting Transport planning and Transportation forecasting Weather forecasting , Flood forecasting and Meteorology Limitations ( edit ) Limitations pose barriers beyond which forecasting methods can not reliably predict . There are many events and values that can not be forecast reliably . Events such as the roll of a die or the results of the lottery can not be forecast because they are random events and there is no significant relationship in the data . When the factors that lead to what is being forecast are not known or well understood such as in stock and foreign exchange markets forecasts are often inaccurate or wrong as there is not enough data about everything that affects these markets for the forecasts to be reliable , in addition the outcomes of the forecasts of these markets change the behavior of those involved in the market further reducing forecast accuracy . Performance limits of fluid dynamics equations ( edit ) As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963 , long range weather forecasts , those made at a range of two weeks or more , are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere , owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved . Extremely small errors in the initial input , such as temperatures and winds , within numerical models double every five days .

In addition , ACFA recognizes Russian Shorthairs in white , black , and blue . Domestic cat ( Felis catus ) The Russian Blue is a cat breed that comes in colors varying from a light shimmering silver to a darker , slate grey . They develop close bonds with their owners and are sought out as pets due to their personalities , beauty and coat . It is their short , dense coat which has been the hallmark of the Russian breed for more than a century . The dense coat stands out from the body and one can draw patterns in the coat that will stay until one smoothes them out again . They are also considered to be hypoallergenic .

They are also sometimes called Archangel Blues . It is believed that sailors took Russian Blues from the Archangel Isles to Great Britain and Northern Europe in the 1860s . The first recorded appearance outside of Russia was in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in England as the Archangel Cat . The Russian Blue competed in a class including all other blue cats until 1912 , when it was given its own class . The breed was developed mainly in England and Scandinavia until after World War II . Right after the war , a lack of numbers of Russian Blues led to cross breeding with the Siamese . Although Russian Blues were in the United States before the war , it was not until the post-war period that American breeders created the modern Russian Blue that is seen in the United States today . This was done by combining the bloodlines of both the Scandinavian and British Russian Blues . The Siamese traits have now largely been bred out . The short hair and slate - gray \/ blue color is often seen in mixed - breed cats , which can affect breeders and showers due to mislabeling a cat as a Russian Blue . Russian Blues are plush short - haired , shimmering pale blue - gray cats with emerald green eyes . Guard hairs are distinctly silver - tipped giving the cat a silvery sheen or lustrous appearance . They have been used on a limited basis to create other breeds such as the Havana Brown or alter existing breeds such as the Nebelung . They are being used in Italy as a way to make Oriental Shorthairs healthier and more robust called RUS4OSH in FIFe . Russian Whites and Russian Blacks were created from crosses with domestic white cats which were allegedly imported from Russia . The first line was developed by Frances McLeod ( Arctic ) in the United Kingdom during the 1960s and the second line produced by Dick and Mavis Jones ( Myemgay ) in Australia in the 1970s . By the late 1970s , the Russian White and Russian Black colors were accepted by cat fanciers in Australia as well as in South Africa and now also in the United Kingdom as Russian cats ( in different classes ) . However , the Cat Fanciers ' Association and FIFe does not recognize any variation of the Russian Blue . Physical characteristics ( edit ) 4 -- 5 month - old Russian Blue kittens 2 month - old CFA Russian Blue The Russian Blue has bright green eyes , pinkish lavender or mauve paws , two layers of short thick fur , and a blue - grey coat . The color is a bluish - gray that is the dilute expression of the black gene . However , as dilute genes are recessive ( `` d '' ) and each parent will have a set of two recessive genes ( `` dd '' ) two non-CPC Russian Blues will always produce a blue cat . Due to the breeding with Siamese after World War II , there are colorpoint genes floating around . If two carriers are bred together , then they will produce a litter of mixed colors -- solid blue or white with blue like a Siamese . People call these CPC cats `` colorpoint '' , `` whites '' or `` pointed '' Russians . In most registries , one can not register , breed or show a colorpoint Russian . The coat is known as a `` double coat '' , with the undercoat being soft , downy and equal in length to the guard hairs , which are an even blue with silver tips . However , the tail may have a few very dull , almost unnoticeable stripes . The coat is described as thick , plush and soft to the touch . The feeling is softer than the softest silk . The silver tips give the coat a shimmering appearance . Its eyes are almost always a dark and vivid green . Any white patches of fur or yellow eyes in adulthood are seen as flaws in show cats . Russian Blues should not be confused with British Blues ( which are not a distinct breed , but rather a British Shorthair with a blue coat as the British Shorthair breed itself comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns ) , nor the Chartreux or Korat which are two other naturally occurring breeds of blue cats , although they have similar traits . Behavioral characteristics ( edit ) A Russian Blue male Russian Blue 's green eyes The Russian Blue is a curious and tranquil animal . They are known for their friendliness and intelligence and are somewhat reserved . They have been known to play fetch , open doors and are sensitive to human emotions . They enjoy playing with a variety of toys and develop loyal bonds to their loved ones and other family pets . They are generally considered to be a quiet breed but there are always exceptions . They are clean animals that are normally reserved around strangers , unless they are brought up in an active household . Many Russian Blues have been trained to do tricks . They can also be fierce hunters , often catching rodents , birds , rabbits , small mammals , or reptiles . Russian Blue kittens are energetic and require adequate playmates or toys as they can become mischievous if bored . They have exceptional athleticism and rival even Abyssinians for their ability to leap and climb . Slow to mature , Russian Blues retain many of their adolescent traits both good and otherwise until they are 3 -- 4 years old and even much older Blues can be easily enticed into play by their owners . Russian Blues are also as mentioned above highly intelligent , they have an excellent memory and will learn the hiding place of favourite toys ( e.g. laser pointers ) and lead their owners to them when they want a game . They also have a keen ability to remember favourite visitors and will race to greet familiar faces even if quite some time has passed between visits -- a radical departure from their normally very reserved behaviour around unfamiliar people . Growth and maturity ( edit ) Russian Blues have a life expectancy of around 10 -- 20 years , but some have even lived up to a maximum of 25 years and have few health problems as they tend to have little to no genetic problems and are not prone to illness . They are small to moderate - sized cats with an average weight of 2.27 to 5.45 kg ( 5.0 to 12.0 lb ) when full grown . Males will typically be larger than females . Their gestation period is approximately 64 days . Allergies ( edit ) See also : Allergy to cats \u00a7 Hypoallergenic cats Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Russian Blue may be better tolerated by individuals with mild to moderate allergies . There is speculation that the Russian Blue produces less glycoprotein Fel d 1 , one source of cat allergies . The thicker coat may also trap more of the allergens closer to the cat 's skin . Glycoprotein is one source of cat allergies , but this does not mean they are suitable to be homed with people allergic to cats as they will still cause the allergy to be affected , only to a lesser degree for short periods of time . In popular culture ( edit ) One of the most famous cartoon cats , Tom from Tom and Jerry , is supposed to resemble a Russian Blue . Felicity , a character in the novel and film Felidae , was a Russian Blue . A Russian Blue kitten is a trained assassin in the Cats & Dogs film . According to audio commentary on the DVD , several kittens were used due to the kittens growing faster than the filming schedule . Eben and Snooch are Russian Blues in the comic Two Lumps . The Nyan Cat meme was inspired by creator Chris Torres ' Russian Blue , Marty . Marty died in 2012 from feline infectious peritonitis . In the Warriors series , Bluestar is a Russian Blue cat .

Breed Profiles . The Cat Fanciers ' Association . Retrieved 11 October 2013 . Many believe the Russian Blue is a natural breed originating from the Archangel Isles in northern Russia , where the long winters developed a cat with a dense , plush coat . Rumors also abound that the Russian Blue breed descended from the cats kept by the Russian Czars , which was rumoured to hunt the brown bear . Assuming the Russian Blue did migrate from northern Russia , it was likely via ship to Great Britain and northern Europe in the mid 1860s . Jump up ^ Alderton , David ( 1992 ) .

He served as inspector general and major general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War . He is credited with being one of the fathers of the Continental Army in teaching them the essentials of military drills , tactics , and disciplines . He wrote Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States , the book that served as standard United States drill manual until the American Civil War . He served as General George Washington 's chief of staff in the final years of the war .

Baron Wilhelm von Steuben , and his wife , Elizabeth von Jagvodin . When his father entered the service of Empress Anna , young Friedrich came with him to the Crimea and then to Kronstadt , staying until the Russian war against the Turks under the General Burkhard Christoph von M\u00fcnnich . In 1740 Steuben 's father returned to Prussia and Friedrich was educated in the garrison towns Neisse and Breslau by Jesuits . It is said that at age 14 he served as volunteer with his father in one of the campaigns of the War of the Austrian Succession . First military service ( edit ) Baron von Steuben joined the Prussian Army at age 17 . He served as a second lieutenant during the Seven Years ' War in 1756 , and was wounded at the 1757 Battle of Prague . He served as adjutant to the free battalion of General Johann von Mayr and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1759 . In August 1759 he was wounded a second time at the Battle of Kunersdorf . In June 1761 , he was appointed deputy quartermaster at the general headquarters . Later that year he was taken prisoner by the Russians at Treptow . He subsequently attained the rank of captain , and served as aide - de-camp to Frederick the Great ; in 1762 he was one of 13 young officers chosen to participate in a special course of instruction delivered by the king himself . Upon the reduction of the army at the end of the war , in 1763 , Steuben was one of many officers who found themselves unemployed . Towards the end of his life , Steuben indicated in a letter that `` an inconsiderate step and an implacable personal enemy '' led to his leaving the Prussian army . Service in Hohenzollern - Hechingen ( edit ) In 1764 Steuben became Hofmarschall to F\u00fcrst Josef Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern - Hechingen , a post he held until 1777 . In 1769 the Duchess of Wurttemberg , niece of Frederick the Great , presented him with the `` Cross of the Order of De la Fidelite '' . In 1771 he began to use the title baron . That same year he accompanied the prince to France in 1771 , hoping to borrow money . Failing to find funds , they returned to Germany in 1775 , deeply in debt . In 1763 Steuben had been formally introduced to the future French Minister of War , Claude Louis , Comte de Saint - Germain in Hamburg . They met again in Paris in 1777 . The Count , fully realizing the potential of an officer with Prussian general staff training , introduced him to Benjamin Franklin . Franklin , however , was unable to offer Steuben a rank or pay in the American army . The Continental Congress had grown tired of foreign mercenaries coming to America and demanding a high rank and pay . Promoting these men over qualified American officers caused discontent in the ranks . Von Steuben would have to go to America strictly as a volunteer , and present himself to Congress . Steuben left these first meetings in disgust and returned to Prussia . Steuben found waiting for him allegations that he engaged in homosexual relationships with young men while in the service of Prince Josef Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern - Hechingen . The allegations were never proven , but Steuben knew they would stymie his chances at an officer 's position in Europe . Threatened with prosecution for his alleged homosexuality , Steuben returned to Paris . Rumors followed him from Prussia to America that he was homosexual , but there never was an investigation of von Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war . Upon the Count 's recommendation , Steuben was introduced to future president George Washington by means of a letter from Franklin as a `` Lieutenant General in the King of Prussia 's service '' , an exaggeration of his actual credentials that appears to be based on a mistranslation of his service record . He was advanced travel funds and left Europe from Marseilles on Friday , September 26 , 1777 on board the frigate Flamand . American Revolution ( edit ) Portrait of Steuben by Ralph Earl The Baron , his Italian greyhound , Azor ( which he took with him everywhere ) , his young aide de camp Louis de Ponti\u00e8re , his military secretary , Peter Stephen Du Ponceau ( then called Pierre Etienne Du Ponceau ) , and two other companions , reached Portsmouth , New Hampshire on December 1 , 1777 , where they were almost arrested for being British because Steuben had mistakenly outfitted them in red uniforms . They were extravagantly entertained in Boston . On February 5 , 1778 Steuben and his party arrived in York , Pennsylvania , where the Continental Congress had relocated after being ousted from Philadelphia by the British advance . Arrangements were made for Steuben to be paid following the successful completion of the war according to his contributions . He arrived at Valley Forge on February 23 , 1778 , and reported for duty as a volunteer . One soldier 's first impression of the Baron was `` of the ancient fabled God of War ... he seemed to me a perfect personification of Mars . The trappings of his horse , the enormous holsters of his pistols , his large size , and his strikingly martial aspect , all seemed to favor the idea . He turned the volunteers into a great army '' Inspector General ( edit ) Washington appointed von Steuben as temporary inspector general . He went out into the camp to talk with the officers and men , inspect their huts , and scrutinize their equipment . Steuben established standards of sanitation and camp layouts that would still be standard a century and a half later . There had previously been no set arrangement of tents and huts . Men relieved themselves where they wished and when an animal died , it was stripped of its meat and the rest was left to rot where it lay . Steuben laid out a plan to have rows for command , officers and enlisted men . Kitchens and latrines were on opposite sides of the camp , with latrines downhill side . There was the familiar arrangement of company and regimental streets . On May 5 , 1778 , on General Washington 's recommendation , Congress appointed Steuben inspector general of the army , with the rank and pay of major general . Internal administration had been neglected , and no books had been kept either as to supplies , clothing or men . Steuben became aware of the `` administrative incompetence , graft , war profiteering '' that existed . He enforced the keeping of exact records and strict inspections . His inspections saved the army an estimated loss of five to eight thousand muskets . Training program ( edit ) Baron von Steuben Drilling Troops at Valley Forge , by E.A. Abbey ( c. 1904 ) , Pennsylvania State Capitol , Harrisburg Steuben picked 120 men from various regiments , to form an honor guard for General Washington , and used them to demonstrate military training to the rest of the troops . These men in turn trained other personnel at Regimental and Brigade levels . Steuben 's eccentric personality greatly enhanced his mystique . In full military dress uniform , he twice a day trained the soldiers who , at this point , were themselves greatly lacking in proper clothing . As he could only speak and write a small amount of English , Steuben originally wrote the drills in the German dialect of Prussian , the military language of Europe at the time . His secretary , Du Ponceau , then translated the drills from Prussian into French , and a secretary for Washington translated it to English . They did this every single night so Washington could command his soldiers in the morning . Colonel Alexander Hamilton and General Nathanael Greene were of great help in assisting Steuben in drafting a training program for the Army . The Baron 's willingness and ability to work with the men , as well as his use of profanity ( in several different languages ) , made him popular among the soldiers . It is here he met his reputed future lover , Captain Benjamin Walker . Upon meeting Walker for the first time he exclaimed `` If I had seen an angel from Heaven I should not have more rejoiced . '' Within weeks , Walker was Steuben 's aide - de-camp . Steuben introduced a system of progressive training , beginning with the school of the soldier , with and without arms , and going through the school of the regiment . This corrected the previous policy of simply assigning personnel to regiments . Each company commander was made responsible for the training of new men , but actual instruction was done by sergeants specifically selected for being the best obtainable . In the earlier part of the war , the U.S. used the bayonet mostly as a cooking skewer or tool rather than as a fighting instrument . Steuben 's introduction of effective bayonet charges became crucial . In the Battle of Stony Point , U.S. soldiers attacked with unloaded muskets and won the battle solely on Steuben 's bayonet training . The first results of Steuben 's training were in evidence at the Battle of Barren Hill , May 20 , 1778 and then again at the Battle of Monmouth in June 1778 . Steuben , by then serving in Washington 's headquarters , was the first to determine that the enemy was heading for Monmouth . During the winter of 1778 -- 1779 , Steuben prepared Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States , commonly known as the `` Blue Book '' . Its basis was the training plan he had devised at Valley Forge . It was used by the United States Army until 1814 , and affected U.S. drills and tactics until the Mexican War of 1846 . Southern campaign ( edit ) Mount Gulian , Fishkill , N.Y. In 1780 Steuben sat on the court - martial of the British Army officer Major John Andr\u00e9 , captured and charged with espionage in conjunction with the defection of General Benedict Arnold . He later traveled with Nathanael Greene , the new commander of the Southern campaign . He quartered in Virginia since U.S. supplies and soldiers would be provided to the army from there . Steuben would help in the defense of Virginia with approximately 1000 militia fighting a delaying action in the Battle of Blandford . During the spring of 1781 , he aided Greene in the campaign in the south , culminating in the delivery of 450 Virginia Continentals to Lafayette in June . He was forced to take sick leave , rejoining the army for the final campaign at Yorktown , where his role was as commander of one of the three divisions of Washington 's troops . In 1783 , General Von Steuben joined General Knox at Vail 's Gate , near West Point , in the fall of 1782 and in early 1783 moved to the Verplanck homestead , at Mount Gulian , across the Hudson River from Washington 's headquarters in Newburgh . Steuben gave assistance to Washington in demobilizing the army in 1783 as well as aiding in the defense plan of the new nation . In May 1783 Steuben presided over the founding of the Society of the Cincinnati . He was discharged from the military with honor on March 24 , 1784 . Final years ( edit ) Steuben 's log cabin summer residence , Steuben , New York Steuben became a U.S. citizen by act of the Pennsylvania legislature in March 1784 ( and later by the New York authorities in July 1786 ) . With the war over , Steuben resigned from service and first settled with his longtime companion , William North , for whom he created a special room at his retreat he called The Louvre on Manhattan Island , where he became a prominent figure and elder in the German Reformed Church . From 1785 until his death , in 1794 , he served as president of the German Society of the City of New York , a charitable society founded in 1784 to assist German immigrants . Even with the new U.S. Congress giving him large sums of money , he became largely indebted . In 1790 , Congress awarded him a pension of $2,500 a year , which he kept until his death . On December 23 , 1783 , the State of New Jersey presented him with the use of an estate in Bergen County now known as Steuben House , which had been confiscated from Loyalist Jan Zabriskie in 1781 . Located in the formerly strategic New Bridge Landing , the estate included a gristmill and about 40 acres of land . Legislators initially conditioned the grant , requiring Steuben to `` hold , occupy and enjoy the said estate in person , and not by tenant . '' Gen. Philemon Dickinson of the New Jersey Militia informed the baron of this gift and responded to his inquiries that `` there are on the premises an exceeding good House , an excellent barn , together with many useful outbuildings , all of which I am told , want some repairs ... there is ... a Grist - mill ; a good Orchard , some meadow Ground , & plenty of Wood . The distance from N York by land 15 miles , but you may keep a boat & go from your own door to N York by water -- Oysters , Fish & wild fowl in abundance -- Possession will be given to you in the Spring , when you will take a view of the premises . '' Von Steuben spent considerable sums to repair wartime damages to the house and restore its commercial operations under former aide Walker . On September 5 , 1788 , the New Jersey Legislature gave Baron von Steuben full title to the former Zabriskie estate . A month later , recognizing his financial embarrassment , Steuben wrote another former aide - de-camp and companion , William North , recognizing : `` The jersey Estate must and is to be sold . Walker is my administrator , all debts are to be paid out of it . '' On November 6 , 1788 , Steuben again wrote North ( at his new home in Duanesburg ) , noting `` My Jersey Estate is Advertised but not yet Sold , from this Walker Shall immediately pay to you the money , you so generously lend me and all my debts in New - York will be payed . I support my present poverty with more heroism than I Expected . All Clubs and parties are renounced , I seldom leave the House . '' Steuben eventually sold the New Jersey property to a son of the previous owner , and it remained in the Zabriskie family until 1909 . It is the only remaining eighteenth - century building that von Steuben owned . Von Steuben moved upstate and settled in Oneida County on a small estate in the vicinity of Rome , on land granted to him for his military service and where he had spent summers . He was later appointed a regent for what evolved into the University of the State of New York . Personal life ( edit ) Von Steuben was probably gay . His exits from the court of Hohenzollern - Hechingen and from Paris were under clouds of accusation of homosexual activity . Von Steuben arrived in the United States with his 17 - year - old secretary , Peter Stephen Du Ponceau , who is rumored to have been his lover . At Valley Forge , he began close relationships with Benjamin Walker and William North , then both military officers in their 20s , which are assumed by many to have been romantic . Because homosexuality was criminalized at the time , records of his relationships are limited to references in correspondences . Death ( edit ) Von Steuben died on November 28 , 1794 , at his estate in Oneida County , and was buried in a grove at what became the Steuben Memorial State Historic Site ; the estate became part of the town of Steuben , New York , which was named for him . Steuben did not marry and had no children . He did not care much for his European relatives . Thus , he left his estate to his companions and aides - de-camp , Captains Benjamin Walker and William North , with whom he had had an `` extraordinarily intense emotional relationship ... treating them as surrogate sons '' . Legacy ( edit ) General Von Steuben , 1930 Issue Generally , Von Steuben Day takes place in September in many cities throughout the United States . It is often considered the German - American event of the year . Participants march , dance , wear German costumes and play German music , and the event is attended by millions of people . The German - American Steuben Parade is held annually in September in New York City . It is one of the largest parades in the city and is traditionally followed by an Oktoberfest in Central Park as well as celebrations in Yorkville , Manhattan , a German section of New York City . The German - American Steuben Parade has been taking place since 1958 . Chicago also hosts a von Steuben Day parade , which is featured in the U.S. film Ferris Bueller 's Day Off . Philadelphia hosts to a smaller Steuben Parade in the Northeast section of the city . Steubenville , Ohio , has the recreated Fort Steuben , named after our beloved Baron . The Steuben Society was founded in 1919 as `` an educational , fraternal , and patriotic organization of American citizens of German background '' . In the difficult post-World War I years the Society helped the German - American community to reorganize . It is now one of the largest organizations for Americans of German descent . A warship , a submarine , and an ocean liner ( later pressed into military service ) were named in von Steuben 's honor . In World War I the captured German ship SS Kronprinz Wilhelm was renamed as USS Von Steuben , and in World War II there was the Dampfschiff General von Steuben , an ill - fated German luxury passenger ship which was turned into an armed transport ship during the war . During the Cold War , the U.S. Navy submarine USS Von Steuben was named for him . Several locations in the United States are also named Steuben , most of them in his honor . Examples include Steuben County , New York , Steuben County , Indiana , and the city of Steubenville , Ohio . Several buildings are named for Steuben , among them Von Steuben Metropolitan Science Center in Chicago , Illinois , as well as one of the cadet barracks buildings at Valley Forge Military Academy and College . Von Steuben was one of four European military leaders who assisted the U.S. cause during the Revolution and was honored with a statue in Lafayette Square , just north of the White House , in Washington , D.C. The statue by Albert Jaegers was dedicated in 1910 . A copy was dedicated in Potsdam , Germany in 1911 , and destroyed during World War II . A new cast was given in honor of German - American friendship in 1987 , and to celebrate the 750th anniversary of the founding of Berlin . It was installed in the Dahlem district , in what had been the U.S. sector of the formerly divided city . Additional casts are in Potsdam , and in Steuben 's home town of Magdeburg . Statues of Steuben by J. Otto Schweizer can be found in Valley Forge , Pennsylvania and Utica , New York ; in addition to an equestrian statue by Schweizer in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . A bust of Steuben is in the garden of the German Embassy in Washington , D.C. The Steuben House , presented to Steuben as a gift for his services in the Continental Army , is located at New Bridge Landing in River Edge , New Jersey . The house and surrounding farmland were seized in 1781 from a Loyalist family . The house looks much as it did after Steuben renovated it . The State of New Jersey took possession of the historic mansion and one acre of ground for $9,000 on June 27 , 1928 . It was opened as a public museum in September 1939 . The Bergen County Historical Society opens the building for special events . It is under the jurisdiction of the Historic New Bridge Landing Park Commission . Other tributes include Steuben Field , the stadium of the Hamilton College football team . Von Steuben , acting as Alexander Hamilton 's surrogate , laid the cornerstone of the school . Upon graduating , all Hamilton seniors receive as a gift from the college a cane with a tricorn hat at its top in reference to von Steuben . The various depictions of Steuben in popular U.S. media include portrayals by Nehemiah Persoff in the 1979 U.S. TV miniseries The Rebels , Kurt Knudson in the 1984 TV miniseries George Washington , being voiced by Austrian - American Arnold Schwarzenegger in the animated series Liberty 's Kids , and by David Cross on the `` Philadelphia '' episode of Drunk History . In 2007 , a popular documentary DVD was released by LionHeart FilmWorks and director Kevin Hershberger titled Von Steuben 's Continentals : The First American Army . The 60 - minute , live - action documentary details the life , uniforms , camp life , food , weapons , equipment and drill of the Continental soldier 1775 -- 1781 , as taught and developed by Baron von Steuben . Steuben House , River Edge , New Jersey . A gift to Steuben from the State of New Jersey , this is the only extant house he owned .

{"document_plaintext":"Ear - wikipedia Ear For other uses , see Ear ( disambiguation ) . Ear The outer portion of the human ear `` Ear '' pronounced ( British accent ) Details System Auditory system Identifiers Latin Auris MeSH D004423 NeuroLex ID birnlex_1062 TA A01. 1.00. 005 A15. 3.00. 001 FMA 52780 Anatomical terminology ( edit on Wikidata ) This article is one of a series documenting the anatomy of the Human ear Outer ear ( show ) Pinna Tragus Middle ear ( show ) Tympanic membrane Ossicles Malleus Incus Stapes Inner ear ( show ) Vestibules Utricle Saccule Cochlea Semicircular canals The ear is the organ of hearing and , in mammals , balance . In mammals , the ear is usually described as having three parts -- the outer ear , middle ear and the inner ear . The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal . Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals , the word `` ear '' often refers to the external part alone . The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles . The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth , and contains structures which are key to several senses : the semicircular canals , which enable balance and eye tracking when moving ; the utricle and saccule , which enable balance when stationary ; and the cochlea , which enables hearing . The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head , an arrangement that aids sound localisation . The ear develops from the first pharyngeal pouch and six small swellings that develop in the early embryo called otic placodes , which are derived from ectoderm . The ear may be affected by disease , including infection and traumatic damage . Diseases of the ear may lead to hearing loss , tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo , although many of these conditions may also be affected by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear . The ear has been adorned by earrings and other jewelry in numerous cultures for thousands of years , and has been subjected to surgical and cosmetic alterations .

The outer ear ends at the eardrum , and the middle ear can be seen in the tympanic cavity behind . The human ear consists of three parts -- the outer ear , middle ear and inner ear . The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air - filled tympanic cavity of the middle ear by the eardrum . The middle ear contains the three small bones -- the ossicles -- involved in the transmission of sound , and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx , via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube . The inner ear contains the otolith organs -- the utricle and saccule -- and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system , as well as the cochlea of the auditory system . Outer ear Main article : Outer ear The outer ear is the external portion of the ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna ( also called the auricle ) , the ear canal , and the outer layer of the eardrum ( also called the tympanic membrane ) . The pinna consists of the curving outer rim called the helix , the inner curved rim called the antihelix , and opens into the ear canal . The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal , as does the facing antitragus . The hollow region in front of the ear canal is called the concha . The ear canal stretches for about 1 inch ( 2.5 cm ) . The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage , while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone . This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone . The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax . The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum . Two sets of muscles are associated with the outer ear : the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles . In some mammals , these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna . In humans , these muscles have little or no effect . The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve , which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself , as well as to the external ear cavity . The great auricular nerve , auricular nerve , auriculotemporal nerve , and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin . The pinna consists of a single piece of elastic cartilage with a complicated relief on its inner surface and a fairly smooth configuration on its posterior surface . A tubercle , known as Darwin 's tubercle , is sometimes present , lying in the descending part of the helix and corresponding to the ear - tip of mammals . The earlobe consists of areola and adipose tissue . The symmetrical arrangement of the two ears allows for the localisation of sound . The brain accomplishes this by comparing arrival - times and intensities from each ear , in circuits located in the superior olivary complex and the trapezoid bodies which are connected via pathways to both ears . Middle ear Main article : Middle ear The middle ear The middle ear lies between the outer ear and the inner ear . It consists of an air - filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments ; the auditory tube ; and the round and oval windows . The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive , amplify , and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear . The ossicles are the malleus ( hammer ) , incus ( anvil ) , and the stapes ( stirrup ) . The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body . The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube . The three ossicles transmit sound from the outer ear to the inner ear . The malleus receives vibrations from sound pressure on the eardrum , where it is connected at its longest part ( the manubrium or handle ) by a ligament . It transmits vibrations to the incus , which in turn transmits the vibrations to the small stapes bone . The wide base of the stapes rests on the oval window . As the stapes vibrates , vibrations are transmitted through the oval window , causing movement of fluid within the cochlea . The round window allows for the fluid within the inner ear to move . As the stapes pushes the secondary tympanic membrane , fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear . The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15 -- 20 times . Inner ear The outer ear receives sound , transmitted through the ossicles of the middle ear to the inner ear , where it is converted to a nervous signal in the cochlear and transmitted along the vestibulocochlear nerve Main article : Inner ear The inner ear sits within the temporal bone in a complex cavity called the bony labyrinth . A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid - filled recesses , the utricle and saccule . These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea . There are three semicircular canals angled at right angles to each other which are responsible for dynamic balance . The cochlea is a spiral shell - shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing . These structures together create the membranous labyrinth . The bony labyrinth refers to the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth , contained within the temporal bone . The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window , which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear . Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph , which fills the membranous labyrinth . The endolymph is situated in two vestibules , the utricle and saccule , and eventually transmits to the cochlea , a spiral - shaped structure . The cochlea consists of three fluid - filled spaces : the vestibular duct , the cochlear duct , and the tympanic duct . Hair cells responsible for transduction -- changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli are present in the organ of Corti in the cochlea . Blood supply The blood supply of the ear differs according to each part of the ear . The outer ear is supplied by a number of arteries . The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply . The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it . The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery , and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery . The occipital artery also plays a role . The middle ear is supplied by the mastoid branch of either the occipital or posterior auricular arteries and the deep auricular artery , a branch of the maxillary artery . Other arteries which are present but play a smaller role include branches of the middle meningeal artery , ascending pharyngeal artery , internal carotid artery , and the artery of the pterygoid canal . The inner ear is supplied by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery ; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery ; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery ; and the labyrinthine artery , arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery . Function Hearing Main article : Hearing Sound waves travel through the outer ear , are modulated by the middle ear , and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner ear . This nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain , where it is registered as sound . Sound that travels through the outer ear impacts on the eardrum , and causes it to vibrate . The three ossicles bones transmit this sound to a second window ( the oval window ) which protects the fluid - filled inner ear . In detail , the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound , which impacts on the eardrum . The malleus rests on the membrane , and receives the vibration . This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window . Two small muscles , the tensor tympani and stapedius , also help modulate noise . The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations . Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea . The inner ear houses the apparatus necessary to change the vibrations transmitted from the outside world via the middle ear into signals passed along the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brain . The hollow channels of the inner ear are filled with liquid , and contain a sensory epithelium that is studded with hair cells . The microscopic `` hairs '' of these cells are structural protein filaments that project out into the fluid . The hair cells are mechanoreceptors that release a chemical neurotransmitter when stimulated . Sound waves moving through fluid flows against the receptor cells of the organ of Corti . The fluid pushes the filaments of individual cells ; movement of the filaments causes receptor cells to become open to receive the potassium - rich endolymph . This causes the cell to depolarise , and creates an action potential that is transmitted along the spiral ganglion , which sends information through the auditory portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the temporal lobe of the brain . The human ear can generally hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz ( the audio range ) . Sounds outside this range are considered infrasound ( below 20 Hz ) or ultrasound ( above 20 kHz ) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory portion of the central nervous system as well as a working ear , human deafness ( extreme insensitivity to sound ) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear , rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system . Balance Main articles : Balance ( ability ) and Equilibrioception Providing balance , when moving or stationary , is also a central function of the ear . The ear facilitates two types of balance : static balance , which allows a person to feel the effects of gravity , and dynamic balance , which allows a person to sense acceleration . Static balance is provided by two ventricles , the utricle and the saccule . Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments , and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer . Each cell has 50 -- 70 small filaments , and one large filament , the kinocilium . Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths , tiny formations of calcium carbonate . When a person moves , these otoliths shift position . This shift alters the positions of the filaments , which opens ion channels within the cell membranes , creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve . Dynamic balance is provided through the three semicircular canals . These three canals are orthogonal ( at right angles ) to each other . At the end of each canal is a slight enlargement , known as the ampulla , which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula . The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head . When a person changes acceleration , the inertia of the fluid changes . This affects the pressure on the cupula , and results in the opening of ion channels . This causes depolarisation , which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve . Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving , via the vestibulo -- ocular reflex . Development During embryogenesis the ear develops as three distinct structures : the inner ear , the middle ear and the outer ear . Each structure originates from a different germ layer : the ectoderm , endoderm and mesenchyme . Inner ear The otic placode visible on this sketch of a developing embryo . After implantation , around the second to third week the developing embryo consists of three layers : endoderm , mesoderm and ectoderm . The first part of the ear to develop is the inner ear , which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo 's development . Specifically , the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes on either side of the head . Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm , forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle . This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth . Around the 33rd day of development , the vesicles begin to differentiate . Closer to the back of the embryo , they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals . Closer to the front of the embryo , the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule , which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea . Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct . This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens . As the cochlear duct 's mesenchyme begins to differentiate , three cavities are formed : the scala vestibuli , the scala tympani and the scala media . Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph . The scala media contains endolymph . A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop to separate the cochlear duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct , respectively . Parts of the otic vesicle in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve . These form bipolar neurons which supply sensation to parts of the inner ear ( namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals , macular of the utricle and saccule , and organ of Corti ) . The nerve begins to form around the 28th day . Molecular regulation Most of the genes responsible for the regulation of inner ear formation and its morphogenesis are members of the homeobox gene family such as Pax , Msx and Otx homeobox genes . The development of inner ear structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5 \/ Dlx6 , Otx1 \/ Otx2 and Pax2 , which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh . Shh is secreted by the notochord . Middle ear The middle ear and its components develop from the first and second pharyngeal arches . The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from the first part of the pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx . This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess . The ossicles ( malleus , incus and stapes ) normally appear during the first half of fetal development . The first two ( malleus and incus ) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second . All three ossicles develop from the neural crest . Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic cavity wall . Outer ear The ear develops in the lower neck region and moves upwards as the mandible develops . Unlike structures of the inner and middle ear , which develop from pharyngeal pouches , the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft . It is fully expanded by the end of the 18th week of development . The eardrum is made up of three layers ( ectoderm , endoderm and connective tissue ) . The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks . The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus , crus of the helix , and helix , respectively . The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix , antitragus , and earlobe . The outer ears develop in the lower neck . As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes . Clinical significance Hearing loss Perforation Fluid in the middle ear cavity Complications of otitis media that can lead to hearing loss , as seen on otoscope . Main article : Hearing loss Hearing loss may be either partial or total . This may be a result of injury or damage , congenital disease , or physiological causes . When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear , it is known as conductive hearing loss . When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear , vestibulochoclear nerve , or brain , it is known as sensorineural hearing loss . Causes of conductive hearing loss include an ear canal blocked by ear wax , ossicles that are fixed together or absent , or holes in the eardrum . Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build - up in the normally air - filled space , such as by otitis media . Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear 's eardrum and ossicles . Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum . Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones , or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively . Hearing aids or cochlear implants may be used if the hearing loss is severe or prolonged . Hearing aids work by amplifying the sound of the local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss . Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard as if it were a nervous signal , bypassing the cochlea . Congenital abnormalities Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common . These anomalies include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18 . Children may also present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation . In rare cases no pinna is formed ( atresia ) , or is extremely small ( microtia ) . Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly . The ear canal can fail to develop if it does not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction . Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five , with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty . The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby 's hearing and the condition of the ear canal , as well as the middle and inner ear . Depending on the results of tests , reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages , with planning for any possible repairs of the rest of the ear . Approximately one out of one thousand children suffer some type of congenital deafness related to the development of the inner ear . Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography ( CT ) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear . Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development . The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament . Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss . Vertigo Main article : Vertigo Vertigo refers to the inappropriate perception of motion . This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system . One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo , when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal . The displaced otolith rests on the cupola , causing a sensation of movement when there is none . M\u00e9ni\u00e8re 's disease , labyrinthitis , strokes , and other infective and congenital diseases may also result in the perception of vertigo . Injury Outer ear Injuries to the external ear occur fairly frequently , and can leave minor to major deformity . Injuries include : laceration , avulsion injuries , burn and repeated twisting or pulling of an ear , for discipline or torture . Chronic damage to the ears can cause cauliflower ear , a common condition in boxers and wrestlers in which the cartilage around the ears becomes lumpy and distorted owing to persistence of a haematoma around the perichondrium , which can impair blood supply and healing . Owing to its exposed position , the external ear is susceptible to frostbite as well as skin cancers , including squamous - cell carcinoma and basal - cell carcinomas . Middle ear The ear drum may become perforated in the event of a large sound or explosion , when diving or flying ( called barotrauma ) , or by objects inserted into the ear . Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media . These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea , and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry . Treatment may include watchful waiting , antibiotics and possibly surgery , if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected . Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures ( the temporal bone ) can also cause damage to the middle ear . A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections . It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo , and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan . The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery . Inner ear There are two principal damage mechanisms to the inner ear in industrialised society , and both injure hair cells . The first is exposure to elevated sound levels ( noise trauma ) , and the second is exposure to drugs and other substances ( ototoxicity ) . A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty ( 11 % ) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure ( 24 % ) . Furthermore , according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) , approximately twenty - two million ( 17 % ) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise . Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise - induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection . Tinnitus Tinnitus is the hearing of sound when no external sound is present . While often described as a ringing , it may also sound like a clicking , hiss or roaring . Rarely , unclear voices or music are heard . The sound may be soft or loud , low pitched or high pitched and appear to be coming from one ear or both . Most of the time , it comes on gradually . In some people , the sound causes depression , anxiety , or concentration difficulties . Tinnitus is not a disease but a symptom that can result from a number of underlying causes . One of the most common causes is noise - induced hearing loss . Other causes include : ear infections , disease of the heart or blood vessels , M\u00e9ni\u00e8re 's disease , brain tumors , emotional stress , exposure to certain medications , a previous head injury , and earwax . It is more common in those with depression . Society and Culture Stretching of the earlobe and various cartilage piercings The ears have been ornamented with jewelry for thousands of years , traditionally by piercing of the earlobe . In ancient and modern cultures , ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes , allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe . Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings , or from traumatic pull of an earring ( for example , by snagging on a sweater ) , is fairly common . Injury to the ears has been present since Roman times as a method of reprimand or punishment - `` In Roman times , when a dispute arose that could not be settled amicably , the injured party cited the name of the person thought to be responsible before the Praetor ; if the offender did not appear within the specified time limit , the complainant summoned witnesses to make statements . If they refused , as often happened , the injured party was allowed to drag them by the ear and to pinch them hard if they resisted . Hence the French expression `` se faire tirer l'oreille '' , of which the literal meaning is `` to have one 's ear pulled '' and the figurative meaning `` to take a lot of persuading '' . We use the expression `` to tweak ( or pull ) someone 's ears '' to mean `` inflict a punishment '' . '' The pinnae have an effect on facial appearance . In Western societies , protruding ears ( present in about 5 % of ethnic Europeans ) have been considered unattractive , particularly if asymmetric . The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845 , and the first case report in 1881 . Pointy ears are a characteristic of some creatures in folklore such as the French croquemitaine , Brazilian curupira or Japanese earth spider . It has been a feature of characters on art as old as that of Ancient Greece and medieval Europe . Pointy ears are a common characteristic of many creatures in the fantasy genre , including elves , faeries , pixies , hobbits , or orcs . They are a characteristic of creatures in the horror genre , such as vampires . Pointy ears are also found in the science fiction genre ; for example among the Vulcan and Romulan races of the Star Trek universe and the Nightcrawler character from the X-Men universe . Georg von B\u00e9k\u00e9sy was a Hungarian biophysicist born in Budapest , Hungary . In 1961 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on the function of the cochlea in the mammalian hearing organ . The Vacanti mouse was a laboratory mouse that had what looked like a human ear grown on its back . The `` ear '' was actually an ear - shaped cartilage structure grown by seeding cow cartilage cells into a biodegradable ear - shaped mold and then implanted under the skin of the mouse ; then the cartilage naturally grew by itself . It was developed as an alternative to ear repair or grafting procedures and the results met with much publicity and controversy in 1997 . Other animals Primate ears Human & Crab - eating macaque ( Darwin 's tubercle highlighted ) Pinnae of the bat The pinna helps direct sound through the ear canal to the eardrum . The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey , using echolocation signals . These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens , and may be seen in a wide range of animals , including the bat , aye - aye , lesser galago , bat - eared fox , mouse lemur and others . Some large primates such as gorillas and orang - utans ( and also humans ) have undeveloped ear muscles that are non-functional vestigial structures , yet are still large enough to be easily identified . An ear muscle that can not move the ear , for whatever reason , has lost that biological function . This serves as evidence of homology between related species . In humans , there is variability in these muscles , such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions , and it has been said that it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials . In such primates , the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane , an ability which is not common to most monkeys -- a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another . In some animals with mobile pinnae ( like the horse ) , each pinna can be aimed independently to better receive the sound . For these animals , the pinnae help localise the direction of the sound source . African bush elephant Loxodonta africana Fennec fox ( desert regions ) Vulpes zerda Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus Domestic rabbit -- French Lop breed Oryctolagus cuniculus Half - Lop Rabbit Illustration by Charles Darwin , 1868 The ear , with its blood vessels close to the surface , is an essential thermoregulator in some land mammals , including the elephant , the fox , and the rabbit . There are five types of ear carriage in domestic rabbits , some of which have been bred for exaggerated ear length -- a potential health risk that is controlled in some countries . Abnormalities in the skull of a half - lop rabbit were studied by Charles Darwin in 1868 . In marine mammals , Earless seals are one of three groups of Pinnipedia . Invertebrates Only vertebrate animals have ears , though many invertebrates detect sound using other kinds of sense organs . In insects , tympanal organs are used to hear distant sounds . They are located either on the head or elsewhere , depending on the insect family . The tympanal organs of some insects are extremely sensitive , offering acute hearing beyond that of most other animals . The female cricket fly Ormia ochracea has tympanal organs on each side of her abdomen . They are connected by a thin bridge of exoskeleton and they function like a tiny pair of eardrums , but , because they are linked , they provide acute directional information . The fly uses her `` ears '' to detect the call of her host , a male cricket . Depending on where the song of the cricket is coming from , the fly 's hearing organs will reverberate at slightly different frequencies . This difference may be as little as 50 billionths of a second , but it is enough to allow the fly to home in directly on a singing male cricket and parasitise it . Simpler structures allow other arthropods to detect near - field sounds . Spiders and cockroaches , for example , have hairs on their legs which are used for detecting sound . Caterpillars may also have hairs on their body that perceive vibrations and allow them to respond to sound . See also Righting reflex Hearing Hearing test Hear , hear References Jump up ^ `` Ear '' .

{"document_plaintext":"Diphtheria - wikipedia Diphtheria Jump to : navigation , search `` Diphthera '' redirects here . For the genus of moth , see Diphthera ( moth ) . Diphtheria Diphtheria can cause a swollen neck , sometimes referred to as a bull neck . Specialty Infectious disease Symptoms Sore throat , fever , barky cough Usual onset 2 -- 5 days post-exposure Causes Corynebacterium diphtheriae ( spread by direct contact and through the air ) Diagnostic method Throat appearance , culture Prevention Diphtheria vaccine Treatment Antibiotics , tracheostomy Frequency 4,500 ( reported 2015 ) Deaths 2,100 ( 2015 ) Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae . Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe . They usually start two to five days after exposure . Symptoms often come on fairly gradually , beginning with a sore throat and fever . In severe cases , a grey or white patch develops in the throat . This can block the airway and create a barking cough as in croup . The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes . A form of diphtheria that involves the skin , eyes , or genitals also exists . Complications may include myocarditis , inflammation of nerves , kidney problems , and bleeding problems due to low levels of platelets . Myocarditis may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis . Diphtheria is usually spread between people by direct contact or through the air . It may also be spread by contaminated objects . Some people carry the bacteria without having symptoms , but can still spread the disease to others . The three main types of C. diphtheriae cause different severities of disease . The symptoms are due to a toxin produced by the bacteria . Diagnosis can often be made based on the appearance of the throat with confirmation by microbiological culture . Previous infection may not prevent against future infection . A diphtheria vaccine is effective for prevention and available in a number of formulations . Three or four doses , given along with tetanus vaccine and pertussis vaccine , are recommended during childhood . Further doses of diphtheria - tetanus vaccine are recommended every ten years . Protection can be verified by measuring the antitoxin level in the blood . Diphtheria can be treated with the antibiotics erythromycin or benzylpenicillin . These antibiotics may also be used for prevention in those who have been exposed to the infection . A tracheotomy is sometimes needed to open the airway in severe cases . In 2015 , 4,500 cases were officially reported worldwide , down from nearly 100,000 in 1980 . About a million cases a year are believed to have occurred before the 1980s . Diphtheria currently occurs most often in sub-Saharan Africa , India , and Indonesia . In 2015 , it resulted in 2,100 deaths , down from 8,000 deaths in 1990 . In areas where it is still common , children are most affected . It is rare in the developed world due to widespread vaccination . In the United States , 57 cases were reported between 1980 and 2004 . Death occurs in 5 % to 10 % of those affected . The disease was first described in the 5th century BC by Hippocrates . The bacterium was discovered in 1882 by Edwin Klebs . Contents ( hide ) 1 Signs and symptoms 1.1 Diphtheritic croup 2 Transmission 3 Mechanism 4 Diagnosis 4.1 Laboratory criteria 4.2 Clinical criteria 4.3 Case classification 5 Prevention 6 Treatment 7 Epidemiology 8 History 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links Signs and symptoms ( edit ) An adherent , dense , grey pseudomembrane covering the tonsils is classically seen in diphtheria . A diphtheria skin lesion on the leg The symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection . Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38 \u00b0 C ( 100.4 \u00b0 F ) or above , chills , fatigue , bluish skin coloration ( cyanosis ) , sore throat , hoarseness , cough , headache , difficulty swallowing , painful swallowing , difficulty breathing , rapid breathing , foul - smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge , and lymphadenopathy . Within two to three days , diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system . The dead tissue forms a thick , gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose . This thick gray coating is called a `` pseudomembrane . '' It can cover tissues in the nose , tonsils , voice box , and throat , making it very hard to breathe and swallow . Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias , myocarditis , and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies . Diphtheritic croup ( edit ) Laryngeal diphtheria can lead to a characteristic swollen neck and throat , or `` bull neck '' . The swollen throat is often accompanied by a serious respiratory condition , characterized by a brassy or `` barking '' cough , stridor , hoarseness , and difficulty breathing , and historically referred to variously as `` diphtheritic croup '' , `` true croup '' , or sometimes simply as `` croup '' . Diphtheritic croup is extremely rare in countries where diphtheria vaccination is customary . As a result , the term `` croup '' nowadays most often refers to an unrelated viral illness that produces similar but milder respiratory symptoms . Transmission ( edit ) Human - to - human transmission of diphtheria typically occurs through the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes . Breathing in particles released from the infected individual leads to infection . Contact with any lesions on the skin can also lead to transmission of diphtheria , but this is uncommon . Indirect infections can occur , as well . If an infected individual touches a surface or object , the bacteria can be left behind and remain viable . Also , some evidence indicates diphtheria has the potential to be zoonotic , but this has yet to be confirmed . Corynebacterium ulcerans has been found in some animals , which would suggest zoonotic potential . Mechanism ( edit ) Diphtheria toxin is produced by C. diphtheriae only when infected with a bacteriophage that integrates the toxin - encoding genetic elements into the bacteria . Diphtheria toxin is a single , 60 - kDa - molecular weight protein composed of two peptide chains , fragment A and fragment B , held together by a disulfide bond . Fragment B is a recognition subunit that gains the toxin entry into the host cell by binding to the EGF - like domain of heparin - binding EGF - like growth factor on the cell surface . This signals the cell to internalize the toxin within an endosome via receptor - mediated endocytosis . Inside the endosome , the toxin is split by a trypsin - like protease into its individual A and B fragments . The acidity of the endosome causes fragment B to create pores in the endosome membrane , thereby catalysing the release of fragment A into the cell 's cytoplasm . Fragment A inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in the affected cell by catalyzing ADP - ribosylation of elongation factor EF - 2 -- a protein that is essential to the translation step of protein synthesis . This ADP - ribosylation involves the transfer of an ADP - ribose from NAD+ to a diphthamide ( a modified histidine ) residue within the EF - 2 protein . Since EF - 2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P - site of the ribosome during protein translation , ADP - ribosylation of EF - 2 prevents protein synthesis . ADP - ribosylation of EF - 2 is reversed by giving high doses of nicotinamide ( a form of vitamin B ) , since this is one of the reaction 's end products , and high amounts drive the reaction in the opposite direction . Diagnosis ( edit ) The current clinical case definition of diphtheria used by the United States ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is based on both laboratory and clinical criteria . Laboratory criteria ( edit ) Isolation of C. diphtheriae from a Gram stain or throat culture from a clinical specimen , Histopathologic diagnosis of diphtheria by Albert 's stain Clinical criteria ( edit ) Upper respiratory tract illness with sore throat Low - grade fever ( above 39 \u00b0 C ( 102 \u00b0 F ) is rare ) An adherent , dense , grey pseudomembrane covering the posterior aspect of the pharynx : in severe cases , it can extend to cover the entire tracheobronchial tree . Case classification ( edit ) Probable : a clinically compatible case that is not laboratory - confirmed and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory - confirmed case Confirmed : a clinically compatible case that is either laboratory - confirmed or epidemiologically linked to a laboratory - confirmed case Empirical treatment should generally be started in a patient in whom suspicion of diphtheria is high . Prevention ( edit ) Quinvaxem is a widely administered pentavalent vaccine , which is a combination of five vaccines in one that protect babies from diphtheria , among other common childhood diseases . Diphtheria vaccine is usually combined at least with tetanus vaccine ( Td ) and often with pertussis ( DTP , DTaP , TdaP ) vaccines , as well . Treatment ( edit ) The disease may remain manageable , but in more severe cases , lymph nodes in the neck may swell , and breathing and swallowing are more difficult . People in this stage should seek immediate medical attention , as obstruction in the throat may require intubation or a tracheotomy . Abnormal cardiac rhythms can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later , and can lead to heart failure . Diphtheria can also cause paralysis in the eye , neck , throat , or respiratory muscles . Patients with severe cases are put in a hospital intensive care unit and given a diphtheria antitoxin . Since antitoxin does not neutralize toxin that is already bound to tissues , delaying its administration is associated with an increase in mortality risk . Therefore , the decision to administer diphtheria antitoxin is based on clinical diagnosis , and should not await laboratory confirmation . Antibiotics have not been demonstrated to affect healing of local infection in diphtheria patients treated with antitoxin . Antibiotics are used in patients or carriers to eradicate C. diphtheriae and prevent its transmission to others . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends either : Metronidazole Erythromycin is given ( orally or by injection ) for 14 days ( 40 mg \/ kg per day with a maximum of 2 g \/ d ) , or Procaine penicillin G is given intramuscularly for 14 days ( 300,000 U \/ d for patients weighing < 10 kg and 600,000 U \/ d for those weighing > 10 kg ) ; patients with allergies to penicillin G or erythromycin can use rifampin or clindamycin . In cases that progress beyond a throat infection , diphtheria toxin spreads through the blood and can lead to potentially life - threatening complications that affect other organs , such as the heart and kidneys . Damage to the heart caused by the toxin affects the heart 's ability to pump blood or the kidneys ' ability to clear wastes . It can also cause nerve damage , eventually leading to paralysis . About 40 % to 50 % of those left untreated can die . Epidemiology. ( edit ) Disability - adjusted life year for diphtheria per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004 no data \u2264 1 1 -- 2 2 -- 3 3 -- 4 4 -- 5 5 -- 6 6 -- 7 7 -- 9 9 -- 10 10 -- 15 15 -- 50 \u2265 50 Diphtheria cases reported to the World Health Organization between 1997 and 2006 : no data 1 -- 49 reported cases Between 50 and 99 reported cases Over 100 reported cases Diphtheria is fatal in between 5 % and 10 % of cases . In children under five years and adults over 40 years , the fatality rate may be as much as 20 % . In 2013 , it resulted in 3,300 deaths , down from 8,000 deaths in 1990 . The number of cases has changed over the course of the last 2 decades , specifically throughout developing countries . Better standards of living , mass immunization , improved diagnosis , prompt treatment , and more effective health care have led to the decrease in cases worldwide . However , although outbreaks are rare , they still occur worldwide , especially in developed nations such as Germany among unvaccinated children , and Canada . After the breakup of the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s , vaccination rates in its constituent countries fell so low that an explosion of diphtheria cases occurred . In 1991 , 2,000 cases of diphtheria occurred in the USSR . Because of this outbreak , since 1992 , many of the cases reported throughout other parts of Europe have been linked to the NIS epidemic . Belgium ( 3 \/ 3 ) and Finland ( 10 \/ 10 ) come in first , stating that 100 % of cases are connected to this epidemic . However , locations such as Poland and Germany have had a larger number of people diagnosed with Diphtheria overall , but claim that a smaller percentage have been linked directly to the NIS . By 1998 as many as 200,000 cases in the Commonwealth of Independent States were reported , with 5,000 deaths . History ( edit ) This section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose . You can help by converting this section to prose , if appropriate . Editing help is available . ( January 2018 ) In 1613 , Spain experienced an epidemic of diphtheria . The year is known as El A\u00f1o de los Garrotillos ( The Year of Strangulations ) in the history of Spain . In 1735 , a diphtheria epidemic swept through New England . Before 1826 , diphtheria was known by different names across the world . In England , it was known as Boulogne sore throat , as it spread from France . In 1826 , Pierre Bretonneau gave the disease the name diphth\u00e9rite ( from Greek diphthera `` leather '' ) describing the appearance of pseudomembrane in the throat . In 1856 , Victor Fourgeaud described an epidemic of diphtheria in California . In 1878 , Queen Victoria 's daughter Princess Alice and her family became infected with diphtheria , causing two deaths , Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine and Princess Alice herself . In 1883 , Edwin Klebs identified the bacterium and named it Klebs - Loeffler bacterium . The club shape of this bacterium helped Edwin to differentiate it from other bacteria . Over the period of time , it was called Microsporon diphtheriticum , Bacillus diphtheriae , and Mycobacterium diphtheriae . Current nomenclature is Corynebacterium diphtheriae . Friedrich Loeffler was the first person to cultivate C. diphtheriae in 1884 . He used Koch 's postulates to prove association between C. diphtheriae and diphtheria . He also showed that the bacillus produces an exotoxin . A diphtheria immunisation scheme in London , 1941 Joseph P. O'Dwyer introduced the O'Dwyer tube for laryngeal intubation in patients with an obstructed larynx in 1885 . It soon replaced tracheostomy as the emergency diphtheric intubation method . In 1888 , Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin showed that a substance produced by C. diphtheriae caused symptoms of diphtheria in animals . In 1890 , Shibasaburo Kitasato and Emil von Behring immunized guinea pigs with heat - treated diphtheria toxin . The first cure of a person with diphtheria is dated to the 1891 Christmas holiday in Berlin . Von Behring won the first Nobel Prize in medicine in 1901 for his work on diphtheria . In 1895 , H.K. Mulford Company of Philadelphia started production and testing of diphtheria antitoxin in the United States . Park and Biggs described the method for producing serum from horses for use in diphtheria treatment . In 1897 , Paul Ehrlich developed a standardized unit of measure for diphtheria antitoxin . This was the first ever standardization of a biological product , and played an important role in future developmental work on sera and vaccines . In 1901 , 10 of 11 inoculated St. Louis children died from contaminated diphtheria antitoxin . The horse from which the antitoxin was derived died of tetanus . This incident , coupled with a tetanus outbreak in Camden , New Jersey , played an important part in initiating federal regulation of biologic products . On 7 January 1904 , Ruth Cleveland died of diphtheria at the age of 12 years in Princeton , New Jersey . Ruth was the eldest daughter of former President Grover Cleveland and the former first lady Frances Folsom . She was the only one of the Clevelands ' five children who died before adulthood . In 1905 , Franklin Royer , from Philadelphia 's Municipal Hospital , published a paper urging timely treatment for diphtheria and adequate doses of antitoxin . In 1906 , Clemens Pirquet and B\u00e9la Schick described serum sickness in children receiving large quantities of horse - derived antitoxin . Between 1910 and 1911 , B\u00e9la Schick developed the Schick test to detect pre-existing immunity to diphtheria in an exposed person . Only those who were not exposed to diphtheria were preferably vaccinated . A massive , five - year campaign was coordinated by Dr. Schick . As a part of the campaign , 85 million pieces of literature were distributed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company with an appeal to parents to `` Save your child from diphtheria . '' A vaccine was developed in the next decade , and deaths began declining significantly in 1924 . A poster from the United Kingdom advertising diphtheria immunisation ( published prior to 1962 ) In 1919 , in Dallas , Texas , 10 children were killed and 60 others made seriously ill by toxic antitoxin which had passed the tests of the New York State Health Department . Mulford Company of Philadelphia ( manufacturers ) paid damages in every case . In the 1920s , an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 cases of diphtheria occurred per year in the United States , causing 13,000 to 15,000 deaths per year . Children represented a large majority of these cases and fatalities . One of the most infamous outbreaks of diphtheria was in Nome , Alaska ; the `` Great Race of Mercy '' to deliver diphtheria antitoxin is now celebrated by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race . In 1926 , Alexander Thomas Glenny increased the effectiveness of diphtheria toxoid by treating it with aluminum salts . During the same period of the 1920s through 1930s when the outbreaks greatly declined , the use of water chlorination systems for the public water supply had also first become a standard municipal practice in developed countries such as the US - Drinking water filtration and chlorination had virtually eliminated major epidemics of waterborne diseases such as Diphtheria in the U.S at the end of this period . In 1943 , diphtheria outbreaks accompanied war and disruption in Europe . The 1 million cases in Europe resulted in 50,000 deaths . In 1949 , 68 of 606 children died after diphtheria immunization due to improper manufacture of aluminum phosphate toxoid . In 1974 , World Health Organization included DPT vaccine in their Expanded Programme on Immunization for developing countries . In 1975 , an outbreak of cutaneous diphtheria in Seattle , Washington , was reported . In 1994 , the Russian Federation had 39,703 diphtheria cases . In contrast , in 1990 , only 1,211 cases were reported . In early May 2010 , a case of diphtheria was diagnosed in Port - au - Prince , Haiti , after the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake . The 15 - year - old male patient died while workers searched for antitoxin . In 2013 , three children died of diphtheria in Hyderabad , India . In early June 2015 , a case of diphtheria was diagnosed at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona , Spain . The 6 - year - old child who died of the illness had not been previously vaccinated due to parental opposition to vaccination . It was the first case of diphtheria in the country since 1986 as reported by `` El Mundo '' or from 1998 , as reported by WHO . In March 2016 , a 3 - year - old girl died of diphtheria in the University Hospital of Antwerp , Belgium . In June 2016 , a 3 - year - old , 5 - year - old , and 7 - year - old girl died of diphtheria in Kedah and Malacca , Sabah Malaysia . In January 2017 , more than 300 cases were recorded in Venezuela . In November and December 2017 , an outbreak of diphtheria occurred in Indonesia with more than 600 cases found and 38 fatalities .

Not outlined in any constitutional document , the office exists only as per long - established convention ( originating in Canada 's former colonial power , the United Kingdom ) that stipulates the monarch 's representative , the governor general , must select as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . Canadian prime ministers are styled as The Right Honourable ( French : Le Tr\u00e8s Honorable ) , a privilege maintained for life . The current , and 23rd , Prime Minister of Canada is the Liberal Party 's Justin Trudeau , who was appointed on November 4 , 2015 , by Governor General David Johnston , following the general election that took place that year . Contents 1 Origin of the office 2 Qualifications and selection 3 Term of office 4 Role and authority 5 Privileges 6 Style of address 7 Prime Minister - designate of Canada 8 Activities post-commission 9 See also 10 Notes 11 References 12 External links Origin of the office ( edit ) The position of prime minister is not outlined in any Canadian constitutional document and is mentioned only in passing in the Constitution Act , 1982 , and the Letters Patent , 1947 issued by King George VI . The office and its functions are instead governed by constitutional conventions and modelled on the same office in the United Kingdom . Qualifications and selection ( edit ) The prime minister , along with the other ministers in cabinet , is appointed by the governor general on behalf of the monarch . However , by the conventions of responsible government , designed to maintain administrative stability , the governor general will call to form a government the individual most likely to receive the support , or confidence , of a majority of the directly elected members of the House of Commons ; as a practical matter , this is often the leader of a party whose members form a majority , or a very large plurality , of Members of Parliament ( MPs ) . While there is no legal requirement for the prime minister to be a member of parliament , for practical and political reasons the prime minister is expected to win a seat very promptly . However , in rare circumstances individuals who are not sitting members of the House of Commons have been appointed to the position of prime minister . Two former prime ministers -- Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell -- served in the 1890s while members of the Senate . Both , in their roles as Government Leader in the Senate , succeeded prime ministers who had died in office -- John A. Macdonald in 1891 and John Sparrow David Thompson in 1894 . That convention has since evolved toward the appointment of an interim leader from the commons in such a scenario . Prime ministers who are not Members of Parliament upon their appointment ( or who lose their seats while in office ) have since been expected to seek election to the commons as soon as possible . For example , William Lyon Mackenzie King , after losing his seat in the 1925 federal election ( that his party won ) , briefly `` governed from the hallway '' before winning a by - election a few weeks later . Similarly , John Turner replaced Pierre Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in 1984 and subsequently was appointed prime minister while not holding a seat in the House of Commons ; Turner won a riding in the next election but the Liberal Party was swept from power . Turner was the last serving prime minister to not hold a commons seat . Sir John A. Macdonald , the first Prime Minister of Canada ( 1867 -- 1873 , 1878 -- 1891 ) Should a serving prime minister today lose his or her seat in the legislature , or should a new prime minister be appointed without holding a seat , the typical process that follows is that a junior member in the governing political party will resign to allow the prime minister to run in the resulting by - election . A safe seat is usually chosen ; while the Liberal and Conservative parties traditionally observed a convention of not running a candidate against another party 's new leader in the by - election , the New Democrats and smaller political parties typically do not follow the same convention . However , if the governing party selects a new leader shortly before an election is due , and that new leader is not a member of the legislature , he or she will normally await the upcoming election before running for a seat in parliament . In a poll conducted by Ipsos - Reid following the first prorogation of the 40th parliament on December 4 , 2008 , it was found that 51 % of the sample group thought the prime minister was directly elected by Canadians . Term of office ( edit ) The Canadian prime minister serves at Her Majesty 's pleasure , meaning the post does not have a fixed term . Once appointed and sworn in by the governor general , the prime minister remains in office until he or she resigns , is dismissed , or dies . The lifespan of parliament was limited by the constitution to five years and , though the governor general may still , on the advice of the prime minister , dissolve parliament and issue the writs of election prior to the date mandated by the Canada Elections Act ; the King -- Byng Affair was the only time since Confederation that the governor general deemed it necessary to refuse his prime minister 's request for a general vote . As of 2007 , with an amendment to the Elections Act , Section 56.1 ( 2 ) was changed to limit the term of a majority government to four years , with election day being set as the third Monday in October of the fourth calendar year after the previous polling date . Following parliamentary dissolution , the prime minister must run in the resulting general election if he or she wishes to maintain a seat in the House of Commons . Should the prime minister 's party subsequently win a majority of seats in the House of Commons , it is unnecessary to re-appoint the prime minister or again swear him or her into office . If , however , an opposition party wins a majority of seats , the prime minister may resign or be dismissed by the governor general . Should the prime minister 's party achieve a minority while an opposition party wins a plurality ( i.e. , more seats than any other party but less than a majority ) , the prime minister can attempt to maintain the confidence of the House by forming a coalition with other minority parties . This option was last entertained in 1925 . Role and Authority ( edit ) Further information : Queen 's Privy Council for Canada Canada 's Prime Ministers during its first century . Because the prime minister is , in practice , the most politically powerful member of the Canadian government , he or she is sometimes erroneously referred to as Canada 's head of state , when , in fact , that post is held by the Canadian monarch , represented by the governor general . The prime minister is , instead , the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers , which are governed by the constitution and its conventions . However , the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power . Today , as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy , the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding , meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general , leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions . As such , the prime minister , supported by the Office of the Prime Minister ( PMO ) , controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada 's system of governance , including the governor general , the Cabinet , justices of the Supreme Court , senators , heads of crown corporations , ambassadors to foreign countries , the provincial lieutenant governors , and approximately 3,100 other positions . Further , the prime minister plays a prominent role in the legislative process -- with the majority of bills put before parliament originating in the Cabinet -- and the leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces . William Lyon Mackenzie King , the 10th Prime Minister of Canada ( 1921 -- 1926 ; 1926 -- 1930 ; 1935 -- 1948 ) Pierre Trudeau is credited with , throughout his tenure as prime minister between 1968 and 1984 , consolidating power in the PMO , which is itself filled by political and administrative staff selected at the prime minister 's discretion and unaccountable to parliament . At the end of the 20th century and into the 21st , analysts -- such as Jeffrey Simpson , Donald Savoie , Andrew Coyne , and John Gomery -- argued that both parliament and the Cabinet had become eclipsed by prime ministerial power ; Savoie wrote : `` The Canadian prime minister has little in the way of institutional check , at least inside government , to inhibit his ability to have his way . '' Indeed , the position has been described as undergoing a `` presidentialisation '' , to the point that its incumbents publicly outshine the actual head of state ( and prime minister 's spouses are sometimes called the `` First Lady of Canada '' ) . Former governor general Adrienne Clarkson alluded to what she saw as `` an unspoken rivalry '' that had developed between the prime minister and the Crown . It has been theorized that such is the case in Canada as its parliament is less influential on the executive than in other countries with Westminster parliamentary systems ; particularly , Canada has fewer MPs , a higher turnover rate of MPs after each election , and an Americanised system for selecting political party leaders , leaving them accountable to the party membership rather than caucus , as is the case in the United Kingdom . There do exist checks on the prime minister 's power : the commons may revoke its confidence in an incumbent prime minister and Cabinet or caucus revolts can quickly bring down a serving premier and even mere threats of such action can persuade or compel a prime minister to resign his post , as happened with Jean Chr\u00e9tien . The Reform Act , 2014 , codifies the process by which a caucus may trigger a party leadership review and , if necessary , chose an interim leader , thereby making a prime minister more accountable to the MPs in his or her party . Caucuses may choose to follow these rules , though the decision would be made by recorded vote , thereby subjecting the party 's choice to public scrutiny . The Senate may delay or impede legislation put forward by the Cabinet , such as when Brian Mulroney 's bill creating the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) came before the upper chamber and , given Canada 's federal nature , the jurisdiction of the federal government is limited to areas prescribed by the constitution . Further , as executive power is constitutionally vested in the monarch , meaning the Royal Prerogative belongs to the Crown and not to any of its ministers , the sovereign 's supremacy over the prime minister in the constitutional order is thus seen as a `` rebuff to the pretensions of the elected : As it has been said , when the Prime Minister bows before the Queen , he bows before us ( the Canadian people ) . '' Either the sovereign or his or her governor general may therefore oppose the prime minister 's will in extreme , crisis situations . Near the end of her time as governor general , Adrienne Clarkson stated : `` My constitutional role has lain in what are called ' reserve powers ' : making sure that there is a prime minister and a government in place , and exercising the right ' to encourage , to advise , and to warn ' ( ... ) Without really revealing any secrets , I can tell you that I have done all three . '' Privileges ( edit ) 24 Sussex Drive , the official residence of the Prime Minister of Canada Two official residences are provided to the prime minister -- 24 Sussex Drive in Ottawa and Harrington Lake , a country retreat in Gatineau Park -- as well an office in the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council ( formerly known as Langevin Block ) , across from Parliament Hill . For transportation , the prime minister is granted an armoured car and shared use of two official aircraft -- a CC - 150 Polaris for international flights and a Challenger 601 for domestic trips . The Royal Canadian Mounted Police also furnish constant personal security for the prime minister and his or her family . All of the aforementioned is supplied by the Queen - in - Council through budgets approved by parliament , as is the prime minister 's total annual compensation of CAD $347,400 . The Prime Minister 's total compensation consists of the Member of the House of Commons Basic Sessional Indemnity of CAD $172,400 , the Prime Minister Salary of CAD $172,400 , and the Prime Minister Car Allowance of CAD $2000 . Should a serving or former prime minister die , he or she is accorded a state funeral , wherein their casket lies in state in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill . Only Bowell and the Viscount Bennett were given private funerals , Bennett also being the only former Prime Minister of Canada to die and be buried outside the country and Bowell the only whose funeral was not attended by politicians . John Thompson also died outside Canada , at Windsor Castle , where Queen Victoria permitted his lying - in - state before his body was returned to Canada for a state funeral in Halifax . The mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada , applied to the arms of prime ministers who pursue them In earlier years , it was traditional for the monarch to bestow a knighthood on newly appointed Canadian prime ministers . Accordingly , several carried the prefix Sir before their name ; of the first eight premiers of Canada , only Alexander Mackenzie refused the honour of a knighthood from Queen Victoria . Following the 1919 Nickle Resolution , however , it was against non-binding policy for the sovereign to grant such honorific titles to Canadians ; the last prime minister to be knighted was Sir Robert Borden , who was premier at the time the Nickle Resolution was debated in the House of Commons . Still , Bennett was in 1941 , six years after he stepped down as prime minister , elevated to the peerage by King George VI as Viscount Bennett , of Mickleham in the County of Surrey and of Calgary and Hopewell in the Dominion of Canada . The Canadian Heraldic Authority ( CHA ) has granted former prime ministers an augmentation of honour on the personal coat of arms of those who pursued them . The heraldic badge , referred to by the CHA as the mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada , consists of four red maple leaves joined at the stem on a white field ( `` Argent four maple leaves conjoined in cross at the stem Gules '' ) ; the augmentation has , so far , been granted either as a canton sinister or centred in the chief . To date , former prime ministers Joe Clark , Pierre Trudeau , John Turner , Brian Mulroney , and Kim Campbell were granted arms with the augmentation . Style of address ( edit ) Kim Campbell , the 19th Prime Minister of Canada ( 1993 ) and only female and British Columbia - born individual to hold the office Canada continues the Westminster tradition of using the title Prime Minister when one is speaking to the federal head of government directly ; this is in contrast to the United States protocol of addressing the federal head of government as mister ( as in , Mister President ) ; the Department of Canadian Heritage advises that it is incorrect to use the term Mr Prime Minister . The written form of address for the prime minister should use his or her full parliamentary title : The Right Honourable ( name ) , ( post-nominal letters ) , Prime Minister of Canada . However , while in the House of Commons during Question Period , other members of parliament may address the prime minister as The Right Honourable , Member for ( prime minister 's riding ) or simply The Right Honourable Prime Minister . Former prime ministers retain the prefix The Right Honourable for the remainder of their lives ; should they remain sitting MPs , they may be referred as The Right Honourable Member for ( member 's riding ) or by their portfolio title ( if appointed to one ) , as in The Right Honourable Minister of National Defence . In the decades following Confederation , it was common practice to refer to the prime minister as Premier of Canada , a custom that continued until the First World War , around the time of Robert Borden 's premiership . While contemporary sources will still speak of early prime ministers of Canada as premier , the modern practice is such that the federal head of government is known almost exclusively as the prime minister , while the provincial and territorial heads of government are termed premiers ( save for within Quebec and New Brunswick , where the premiers are addressed in French as Premier ministre du ( province ) , literally translated as Prime Minister of ( province ) ) . Prime minister - designate of Canada ( edit ) Further information : Prime minister - designate The Prime Minister -- designate of Canada refers to the person who has been designated as the future prime minister by the Governor General , after either winning a general election , forming a confidence and supply government , or forming an coalition government . The term does not apply to incumbent prime ministers . Activities post-commission ( edit ) After exiting office , former prime ministers of Canada have engaged in various pursuits . Some remained in politics : Bowell continued to serve as a senator , Stephen Harper returned to the House of Commons as a backbench Member of Parliament , and Bennett moved to the United Kingdom after being elevated to the House of Lords . A number led Her Majesty 's Loyal Opposition in the Canadian parliament : John A. Macdonald , Arthur Meighen , Mackenzie King , and Pierre Trudeau , all before being re-appointed as prime minister ( Mackenzie King twice ) ; Alexander Mackenzie and John Diefenbaker , both prior to sitting as regular Members of Parliament until their deaths ; Wilfrid Laurier dying while still in the post ; and Charles Tupper , Louis St. Laurent , and John Turner , each before they returned to private business . Meighen was also appointed to the Senate following his second period as prime minister , but resigned his seat to seek re-election and moved to private enterprise after failing to win a riding . Following Meighen into civilian life were : Robert Borden , who served as Chancellor of Queen 's and McGill Universities , as well as working in the financial sector ; Lester B. Pearson , who acted as Chancellor of Carleton University ; Joe Clark and Kim Campbell , who became university professors , Clark also consultant and Campbell working in international diplomacy and as the director of private companies and chairperson of interest groups ; while Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chr\u00e9tien returned to legal practice . Former prime ministers also commonly penned autobiographies -- Tupper , for example -- or published their memoirs -- such as Diefenbaker and Paul Martin .

{"document_plaintext":"Parens patriae - wikipedia Parens patriae Jump to : navigation , search Parens patriae is Latin for `` parent of the nation '' ( lit. , `` parent of the fatherland '' ) . In law , it refers to the public policy power of the state to intervene against an abusive or negligent parent , legal guardian , or informal caretaker , and to act as the parent of any child or individual who is in need of protection . For example , some children , incapacitated individuals , and disabled individuals lack parents who are able and willing to render adequate care , thus requiring state intervention . In U.S. litigation , parens patriae can be invoked by the state to create its standing to sue ; the state declares itself to be suing on behalf of its people . For example , the Hart - Scott - Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 ( 15 USC 15c ) , through Section 4C of the Clayton Act , permits state attorneys general to bring parens patriae suits on behalf of those injured by violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act . Contents ( hide ) 1 Discussion 2 Parens patriae in US federal courts 3 See also 4 Further reading 5 References Discussion ( edit ) Parens patriae relates to a notion initially invoked by the King 's Bench in the sixteenth century in cases of non compos mentis adults . The notion dates from at least 1608 , as recorded in Coke 's Report of Calvin 's Case , wherein it is said `` that moral law , honora patrem ... doubtless doth extend to him that is pater patri\u00e6 . '' The parens patriae doctrine was gradually applied to children throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and has since evolved from one granting absolute rights to the sovereign to one more associated with rights and obligations of the state and courts towards children and incapacitated adults . In most jurisdictions , this appears in the principle that makes the protection of the best interests of any child the first and single most important concern of the courts . For example , in any proceedings affecting the validity of a marriage , the children will not be parties in their own right , nor will they be parties to any agreement that the spouses may make . In these proceedings , the courts will often be invited to accept and enforce any agreement between a husband and wife regarding parental responsibility for their children . This will usually be done so long as the agreement is seen to be in the best interests and welfare of the children . Courts are not obliged to invoke the parens patriae doctrine in cases involving children and not all courts , particularly newer courts such as the Australian Family Court ( est 1975 ) , have specific parens patriae jurisdiction . In the United States , some proponents of homeschooling have asserted that the Parens Patriae Doctrine is constrained by a so - called `` Parental Liberty Doctrine . '' In some situations , the parties may have submitted their dispute to formal arbitration proceedings . Such proceedings , whether judicial or quasi-judicial , can not displace the supervisory power of the court in the exercise of its parens patriae function to the child . To the extent that such an award conflicts with the best interests of the child , the courts will treat it as void in respect of the child , even though it might be binding on the parents . The test of the best interests of the child can always be the basis of a challenge by a parent , grandparent , an interested relative , or the child acting through a friend . Thus , for example , the spouses might already have been through a religious form of divorce known as the get before the Beth Din , the Jewish rabbinical court , which included provision for the children . Even though there might appear to be a grant of custody in absolute terms by this court , public policy always requires that it can be reviewed by a secular court and , if the state court is of the view that it is not in the best interests of the child , it will be set aside ( see Stanley G. v. Eileen G. New York Law Journal , 10 - 13 - 94 , P. 22 , Col. 6 , Sup . Ct. , NY Co . ) . Within the EU , the right of the child to be heard in any proceedings is a fundamental right provided in Article 24 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . The views of the child shall be considered on matters which concern them in accordance with their age and maturity . It also provides that the child 's best interest shall be the primary consideration in all actions relating to children , whether taken by public authorities or private institutions . The same principles apply to individuals whose mental capacity is impaired and who are being abused by carers or other individuals , whether family members or otherwise . Since these individuals can not protect themselves , the courts have an inherent jurisdiction to appoint a guardian ad litem for particular proceedings . In English Law , long - term care is arranged through the Court of Protection . Parens patriae in U.S. federal courts ( edit ) The concept of the parens patriae suit has been greatly expanded in the United States federal courts beyond that which existed in England . In Louisiana v. Texas , the State of Louisiana brought suit to enjoin officials of the State of Texas from so administering the Texas quarantine regulations as to prevent Louisiana merchants from sending goods into Texas . The US Supreme Court recognized that Louisiana was attempting to sue , not because of any particular injury to a particular business of the State , but as parens patriae for all its citizens . While the Court found that parens patriae could not properly be invoked in that case , the propriety and utility of parens patriae suits were clearly recognized , thus setting a precedent . Thus , in a series of cases after Louisiana v. Texas the Supreme Court followed that precedent to allow states to sue as parens patriae : Missouri v. Illinois , 180 U.S. 208 ( 1901 ) ( holding that Missouri was permitted to sue Illinois and a Chicago sanitation district on behalf of Missouri citizens to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the Mississippi River ) ; Kansas v. Colorado , 206 U.S. 46 ( 1907 ) ( holding that Kansas was permitted to sue as parens patriae to enjoin the diversion of water from an interstate stream ) ; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co. , 206 U.S. 230 ( 1907 ) ( holding that Georgia was entitled to sue to enjoin fumes from a copper plant across the state border from injuring land in five Georgia counties ) ; New York v. New Jersey , 256 U.S. 296 ( 1921 ) ( holding that New York could sue to enjoin the discharge of sewage into the New York harbor ) ; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U.S. 553 ( 1923 ) ( holding that Pennsylvania might sue to enjoin restraints on the commercial flow of natural gas ) ; North Dakota v. Minnesota , 263 U.S. 365 ( 1923 ) ( holding that Minnesota could sue to enjoin changes in drainage which increase the flow of water in an interstate stream ) . The Supreme Court recognized a different kind of paren patriae suit in Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co . While the earlier cases were common - law actions to prevent or repair harm to a state 's `` quasi-sovereign '' interests . Georgia now sought relief under the federal antitrust statute , alleging that 20 railroads had conspired to restrain trade and to fix prices in a manner that would favor shippers in other States ( particularly Northern States ) to the detriment of Georgia shippers and the state 's economy . The Court upheld Georgia 's claim as parens patriae with respect to injunctive relief , but did not consider whether the antitrust laws also authorized damages for an injury to the State 's economy , because the ICC 's approval of the challenged rates barred any damage recovery . Then , three decades later , in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. , the Court considered a generally similar damages action Hawaii brought under the antitrust laws for damages to its general economy resulting from a price fix by four oil companies . The Court held that the state could sue as parens patriae only for injunctive relief and not for damages . Its citizens would have to sue individually for damages . In Massachusetts v. EPA , a group of states ( mostly coastal states ) sought to sue the EPA to require it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions because they were causing global warming and rising sea levels . `` These rising seas have already begun to swallow Massachusetts ' coastal land . '' The Court stated : In sum -- at least according to petitioners ' uncontested affidavits -- the rise in sea levels associated with global warming has already harmed and will continue to harm Massachusetts . The risk of catastrophic harm , though remote , is nevertheless real . That risk would be reduced to some extent if petitioners received the relief they seek . Therefore , states such as Massachusetts had standing as parens patriae to sue EPA to seeks to require it to regulate to protect their coastlines . The Court held that EPA would have to consider the matter and give a reasoned explanation of whatever its decision on the merits would be . In Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distributors , Inc. , the Fourth Circuit held that several state attorney generals were proper parens patriae plaintiffs to sue a group of car dealers for price fixing , in order to recover damages for their citizen injured by overcharges . The court held that because plaintiffs were authorized to pursue antitrust litigation against defendants on behalf of their states ' natural - person residents under both 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 15c - 15h and state laws and constitutions , they could sue on behalf of their citizens .

Illustration for the cover of the periodical Dadaphone , n . 7 , Paris , March 1920 Dada ( \/ \u02c8d\u0251\u02d0d\u0251\u02d0 \/ ) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant - garde in the early 20th century , with early centers in Z\u00fcrich , Switzerland at the Cabaret Voltaire ( circa 1916 ) ; New York Dada began circa 1915 , and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris . Developed in reaction to World War I , the Dada movement consisted of artists who rejected the logic , reason , and aestheticism of modern capitalist society , instead expressing nonsense , irrationality , and anti-bourgeois protest in their works . The art of the movement spanned visual , literary , and sound media , including collage , sound poetry , cut - up writing , and sculpture . Dadaist artists expressed their discontent with violence , war , and nationalism , and maintained political affinities with the radical left . Cover of the first edition of the publication Dada by Tristan Tzara ; Z\u00fcrich , 1917 There is no consensus on the origin of the movement 's name ; a common story is that the Austrian artist Richard Huelsenbeck plunged a knife at random into a dictionary , where it landed on `` dada '' , a colloquial French term for a hobby horse . Others note that it suggests the first words of a child , evoking a childishness and absurdity that appealed to the group . Still others speculate that the word might have been chosen to evoke a similar meaning ( or no meaning at all ) in any language , reflecting the movement 's internationalism . The roots of Dada lie in pre-war avant - garde . The term anti-art , a precursor to Dada , was coined by Marcel Duchamp around 1913 to characterize works which challenge accepted definitions of art . Cubism and the development of collage and abstract art would inform the movement 's detachment from the constraints of reality and convention . The work of French poets , Italian Futurists and the German Expressionists would influence Dada 's rejection of the tight correlation between words and meaning . Works such as Ubu Roi ( 1896 ) by Alfred Jarry , and the ballet Parade ( 1916 -- 17 ) by Erik Satie would also be characterized as proto - Dadaist works . The Dada movement 's principles were first collected in Hugo Ball 's Dada Manifesto in 1916 . The Dadaist movement included public gatherings , demonstrations , and publication of art \/ literary journals ; passionate coverage of art , politics , and culture were topics often discussed in a variety of media . Key figures in the movement included Hugo Ball , Marcel Duchamp , Emmy Hennings , Hans Arp , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah H\u00f6ch , Johannes Baader , Tristan Tzara , Francis Picabia , Huelsenbeck , George Grosz , John Heartfield , Man Ray , Beatrice Wood , Kurt Schwitters , Hans Richter , Max Ernst , and Elsa von Freytag - Loringhoven among others . The movement influenced later styles like the avant - garde and downtown music movements , and groups including Surrealism , nouveau r\u00e9alisme , pop art and Fluxus .

De Zayas ! Je suis venu sur les rivages du Pont - Euxin , New York , 1915 Dada was an informal international movement , with participants in Europe and North America . The beginnings of Dada correspond to the outbreak of World War I . For many participants , the movement was a protest against the bourgeois nationalist and colonialist interests , which many Dadaists believed were the root cause of the war , and against the cultural and intellectual conformity -- in art and more broadly in society -- that corresponded to the war . Avant - garde circles outside France knew of pre-war Parisian developments . They had seen ( or participated in ) Cubist exhibitions held at Galeries Dalmau , Barcelona ( 1912 ) , Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin ( 1912 ) , the Armory Show in New York ( 1913 ) , SVU M\u00e1nes in Prague ( 1914 ) , several Jack of Diamonds exhibitions in Moscow and at De Moderne Kunstkring , Amsterdam ( between 1911 and 1915 ) . Futurism developed in response to the work of various artists . Dada subsequently combined these approaches . Many Dadaists believed that the ' reason ' and ' logic ' of bourgeois capitalist society had led people into war . They expressed their rejection of that ideology in artistic expression that appeared to reject logic and embrace chaos and irrationality . For example , George Grosz later recalled that his Dadaist art was intended as a protest `` against this world of mutual destruction . '' According to Hans Richter Dada was not art : it was `` anti-art . '' Dada represented the opposite of everything which art stood for . Where art was concerned with traditional aesthetics , Dada ignored aesthetics . If art was to appeal to sensibilities , Dada was intended to offend . As Hugo Ball expressed it , `` For us , art is not an end in itself ... but it is an opportunity for the true perception and criticism of the times we live in . '' A reviewer from the American Art News stated at the time that `` Dada philosophy is the sickest , most paralyzing and most destructive thing that has ever originated from the brain of man . '' Art historians have described Dada as being , in large part , a `` reaction to what many of these artists saw as nothing more than an insane spectacle of collective homicide . '' Years later , Dada artists described the movement as `` a phenomenon bursting forth in the midst of the postwar economic and moral crisis , a savior , a monster , which would lay waste to everything in its path ... ( It was ) a systematic work of destruction and demoralization ... In the end it became nothing but an act of sacrilege . '' To quote Dona Budd 's The Language of Art Knowledge , Dada was born out of negative reaction to the horrors of the First World War . This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Z\u00fcrich . Dada rejected reason and logic , prizing nonsense , irrationality and intuition . The origin of the name Dada is unclear ; some believe that it is a nonsensical word . Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara 's and Marcel Janco 's frequent use of the words `` da , da , '' meaning `` yes , yes '' in the Romanian language . Another theory says that the name `` Dada '' came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French -- German dictionary happened to point to ' dada ' , a French word for ' hobbyhorse ' . The movement primarily involved visual arts , literature , poetry , art manifestos , art theory , theatre , and graphic design , and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works . History ( edit ) Z\u00fcrich ( edit ) Hannah H\u00f6ch , Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer - Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany , 1919 , collage of pasted papers , 90 \u00d7 144 cm , Nationalgalerie , Staatliche Museen zu Berlin In 1916 , Hugo Ball , Emmy Hennings , Tristan Tzara , Jean Arp , Marcel Janco , Richard Huelsenbeck , Sophie Taeuber , and Hans Richter , along with others , discussed art and put on performances in the Cabaret Voltaire expressing their disgust with the war and the interests that inspired it . Some sources state that Dada coalesced on October 6 at the Cabaret Voltaire . Other sources state that Dada did not originate fully in a Z\u00fcrich literary salon but grew out of an already vibrant artistic tradition in Eastern Europe , particularly Romania , that transposed to Switzerland when a group of Jewish modernist artists ( Tzara , Janco , Arthur Segal , and others ) settled in Z\u00fcrich . In the years prior to the First World War similar art had already risen in Bucharest and other Eastern European cities ; it is likely that Dada 's catalyst was the arrival in Z\u00fcrich of artists like Tzara and Janco . Having left Germany and Romania during the Great War , the artists found themselves in Switzerland , a country recognized for its neutrality . Inside this space of political neutrality they decided to use abstraction to fight against the social , political , and cultural ideas of that time . The Dadaists believed those ideas to be a byproduct of bourgeois society , a society so apathetic it would rather fight a war against itself than challenge the status quo . Janco recalled , `` We had lost confidence in our culture . Everything had to be demolished . We would begin again after the tabula rasa . At the Cabaret Voltaire we began by shocking common sense , public opinion , education , institutions , museums , good taste , in short , the whole prevailing order . '' The Cabaret closed its doors in early July and then at the first public soir\u00e9e at Waag Hall on July 14 , 1916 , Ball recited the first manifesto . In 1917 , Tzara wrote a second Dada manifesto considered one of the most important Dada writings , which was published in 1918 . Other manifestos followed . A single issue of the magazine Cabaret Voltaire was the first publication to come out of the movement . After the cabaret closed down , Dada activities moved on to a new gallery , and Hugo Ball left for Bern . Tzara began a relentless campaign to spread Dada ideas . He bombarded French and Italian artists and writers with letters , and soon emerged as the Dada leader and master strategist . The Cabaret Voltaire re-opened , and is still in the same place at the Spiegelgasse 1 in the Niederdorf . Z\u00fcrich Dada , with Tzara at the helm , published the art and literature review Dada beginning in July 1917 , with five editions from Z\u00fcrich and the final two from Paris . Other artists , such as Andr\u00e9 Breton and Philippe Soupault , created `` literature groups to help extend the influence of Dada . '' After the fighting of the First World War had ended in the armistice of November 1918 , most of the Z\u00fcrich Dadaists returned to their home countries , and some began Dada activities in other cities . Others , such as the Swiss native Sophie Taeuber , would remain in Z\u00fcrich into the 1920s . Berlin ( edit ) Cover of Anna Blume , Dichtungen , 1919 `` Berlin was a city of tightened stomachers , of mounting , thundering hunger , where hidden rage was transformed into a boundless money lust , and men 's minds were concentrating more and more on questions of naked existence ... Fear was in everybody 's bones `` - Richard H\u00fclsenbeck The groups in Germany were not as strongly anti-art as other groups . Their activity and art were more political and social , with corrosive manifestos and propaganda , satire , public demonstrations and overt political activities . The intensely political and war - torn environment of Berlin had a dramatic impact on the ideas of Berlin Dadaists . Conversely , New York 's geographic distance from the war spawned its more theoretically - driven , less political nature . In February 1918 , while the Great War was approaching its climax , Huelsenbeck gave his first Dada speech in Berlin , and he produced a Dada manifesto later in the year . Following the October Revolution in Russia , by then out of the war , Hannah H\u00f6ch and George Grosz used Dada to express communist sympathies . Grosz , together with John Heartfield , H\u00f6ch and Hausmann developed the technique of photomontage during this period . After the war , the artists published a series of short - lived political magazines and held the First International Dada Fair , ' the greatest project yet conceived by the Berlin Dadaists ' , in the summer of 1920 . As well as work by the main members of Berlin Dada -- Grosz , Raoul Hausmann , Hannah H\u00f6ch , Johannes Baader , Huelsenbeck and Heartfield -- the exhibition also included the work of Otto Dix , Francis Picabia , Jean Arp , Max Ernst , Rudolf Schlichter , Johannes Baargeld and others . In all , over 200 works were exhibited , surrounded by incendiary slogans , some of which also ended up written on the walls of the Nazi 's Entartete Kunst exhibition in 1937 . Despite high ticket prices , the exhibition lost money , with only one recorded sale . The Berlin group published periodicals such as Club Dada , Der Dada , Everyman His Own Football , and Dada Almanach . Cologne ( edit ) In Cologne , Ernst , Baargeld , and Arp launched a controversial Dada exhibition in 1920 which focused on nonsense and anti-bourgeois sentiments . Cologne 's Early Spring Exhibition was set up in a pub , and required that participants walk past urinals while being read lewd poetry by a woman in a communion dress . The police closed the exhibition on grounds of obscenity , but it was re-opened when the charges were dropped . Marcel Duchamp , Fountain , 1917 ; photograph by Alfred Stieglitz New York ( edit ) Main article : New York Dada Like Z\u00fcrich , New York City was a refuge for writers and artists from the First World War . Soon after arriving from France in 1915 , Marcel Duchamp and Francis Picabia met American artist Man Ray . By 1916 the three of them became the center of radical anti-art activities in the United States . American Beatrice Wood , who had been studying in France , soon joined them , along with Elsa von Freytag - Loringhoven . Arthur Cravan , fleeing conscription in France , was also in New York for a time . Much of their activity centered in Alfred Stieglitz 's gallery , 291 , and the home of Walter and Louise Arensberg . The New Yorkers , though not particularly organized , called their activities Dada , but they did not issue manifestos . They issued challenges to art and culture through publications such as The Blind Man , Rongwrong , and New York Dada in which they criticized the traditionalist basis for museum art . New York Dada lacked the disillusionment of European Dada and was instead driven by a sense of irony and humor . In his book Adventures in the arts : informal chapters on painters , vaudeville and poets Marsden Hartley included an essay on `` The Importance of Being ' Dada ' '' . Rrose S\u00e9lavy , the alter ego of Dadaist Marcel Duchamp During this time Duchamp began exhibiting `` readymades '' ( everyday objects found or purchased and declared art ) such as a bottle rack , and was active in the Society of Independent Artists . In 1917 he submitted the now famous Fountain , a urinal signed R. Mutt , to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition but they rejected the piece . First an object of scorn within the arts community , the Fountain has since become almost canonized by some as one of the most recognizable modernist works of sculpture . Art world experts polled by the sponsors of the 2004 Turner Prize , Gordon 's gin , voted it `` the most influential work of modern art '' . As recent scholarship documents , the work is likely more collaborative than it has been given credit for in twentieth - century art history . Duchamp indicates in a 1917 letter to his sister that a female friend was centrally involved in the conception of this work . As he writes : `` One of my female friends who had adopted the pseudonym Richard Mutt sent me a porcelain urinal as a sculpture . '' The piece is more in line with the scatological aesthetics of Duchamp 's friend and neighbour , the Baroness Elsa von Freytag - Loringhoven , than Duchamp 's . In an attempt to `` pay homage to the spirit of Dada '' a performance artist named Pierre Pinoncelli made a crack in a replica of The Fountain with a hammer in January 2006 ; he also urinated on it in 1993 . Picabia 's travels tied New York , Z\u00fcrich and Paris groups together during the Dadaist period . For seven years he also published the Dada periodical 391 in Barcelona , New York City , Z\u00fcrich , and Paris from 1917 through 1924 . By 1921 , most of the original players moved to Paris where Dada had experienced its last major incarnation . Paris ( edit ) Man Ray , c. 1921 -- 22 , Rencontre dans la porte tournante , published on the cover of Der Sturm , Volume 13 , Number 3 , 5 March 1922 Man Ray , c. 1921 -- 22 , Dessin ( Drawing ) , published on page 43 of Der Sturm , Volume 13 , Number 3 , 5 March 1922 The French avant - garde kept abreast of Dada activities in Z\u00fcrich with regular communications from Tristan Tzara ( whose pseudonym means `` sad in country , '' a name chosen to protest the treatment of Jews in his native Romania ) , who exchanged letters , poems , and magazines with Guillaume Apollinaire , Andr\u00e9 Breton , Max Jacob , Cl\u00e9ment Pansaers , and other French writers , critics and artists . Paris had arguably been the classical music capital of the world since the advent of musical Impressionism in the late 19th century . One of its practitioners , Erik Satie , collaborated with Picasso and Cocteau in a mad , scandalous ballet called Parade . First performed by the Ballets Russes in 1917 , it succeeded in creating a scandal but in a different way than Stravinsky 's Le Sacre du printemps had done almost five years earlier . This was a ballet that was clearly parodying itself , something traditional ballet patrons would obviously have serious issues with . Dada in Paris surged in 1920 when many of the originators converged there . Inspired by Tzara , Paris Dada soon issued manifestos , organized demonstrations , staged performances and produced a number of journals ( the final two editions of Dada , Le Cannibale , and Litt\u00e9rature featured Dada in several editions . ) The first introduction of Dada artwork to the Parisian public was at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1921 . Jean Crotti exhibited works associated with Dada including a work entitled , Explicatif bearing the word Tabu . In the same year Tzara staged his Dadaist play The Gas Heart to howls of derision from the audience . When it was re-staged in 1923 in a more professional production , the play provoked a theatre riot ( initiated by Andr\u00e9 Breton ) that heralded the split within the movement that was to produce Surrealism . Tzara 's last attempt at a Dadaist drama was his `` ironic tragedy '' Handkerchief of Clouds in 1924 . Netherlands ( edit ) In the Netherlands the Dada movement centered mainly around Theo van Doesburg , best known for establishing the De Stijl movement and magazine of the same name . Van Doesburg mainly focused on poetry , and included poems from many well - known Dada writers in De Stijl such as Hugo Ball , Hans Arp and Kurt Schwitters . Van Doesburg and Thijs Rinsema ( nl ) ( a cordwainer and artist in Drachten ) became friends of Schwitters , and together they organized the so - called Dutch Dada campaign in 1923 , where van Doesburg promoted a leaflet about Dada ( entitled What is Dada ? ) , Schwitters read his poems , Vilmos Husz\u00e1r demonstrated a mechanical dancing doll and Nelly van Doesburg ( Theo 's wife ) , played avant - garde compositions on piano . A Bonset sound - poem , `` Passing troop '' , 1916 Van Doesburg wrote Dada poetry himself in De Stijl , although under a pseudonym , I.K. Bonset , which was only revealed after his death in 1931 . ' Together ' with I.K. Bonset , he also published a short - lived Dutch Dada magazine called M\u00e9cano ( 1922 -- 3 ) . Another Dutchman identified by K. Schippers in his study of the movement in the Netherlands was the Groningen typographer H.N. Werkman , who was in touch with van Doesburg and Schwitters while editing his own magazine , The Next Call ( 1923 -- 6 ) . Two more artists mentioned by Schippers were German - born and eventually settled in the Netherlands . These were Otto van Rees , who had taken part in the liminal exhibitions at the Caf\u00e9 Voltaire in Z\u00fcrich , and Paul Citroen . Georgia ( edit ) Although Dada itself was unknown in Georgia until at least 1920 , from 1917 until 1921 a group of poets called themselves `` 41st Degree '' ( referring both to the latitude of Tbilisi , Georgia and to the temperature of a high fever ) organized along Dadaist lines . The most important figure in this group was Iliazd , whose radical typographical designs visually echo the publications of the Dadaists . After his flight to Paris in 1921 , he collaborated with Dadaists on publications and events . Yugoslavia ( edit ) In Yugoslavia there was significant Dada activity between 1920 and 1922 , run mainly by Dragan Aleksi\u0107 and including work by Mihailo S. Petrov , Zenitism 's two brothers Ljubomir Mici\u0107 and Branko Ve Poljanski . Aleksi\u0107 used the term `` Yougo - Dada '' and is known to have been in contact with Raoul Hausmann , Kurt Schwitters , and Tristan Tzara . Italy ( edit ) The Dada movement in Italy , based in Mantua , was met with distaste and failed to make a significant impact in the world of art . It published a magazine for a short time and held an exhibition in Rome , featuring paintings , quotations from Tristan Tzara , and original epigrams such as `` True Dada is against Dada '' . The most notable member of this group was Julius Evola , who went on to become an eminent scholar of occultism , as well as a right - wing philosopher and an assistant to Benito Mussolini . Japan ( edit ) Dada , an iconic character from the Ultra Series . His design draws inspiration from the art movement . A prominent Dada group in Japan was MAVO ( ja ) , founded in July 1923 by Tomoyoshi Murayama and Yanase Masamu ( de ; ja ) . Other prominent artists were Jun Tsuji , Eisuke Yoshiyuki , Shinkichi Takahashi and Katsue Kitasono . In the Tsuburaya Productions 's Ultra Series , an alien named Dada was designed after the Dadaism movement , with said character first appearing in episode 28 of the 1966 tokusatsu series , Ultraman , and was designed by character artist Toru Narita . Dada 's design is primarily monochromatic , and features numerous sharp lines and alternating black and white stripes , as a reference to the movement . On May 19 , 2016 , in celebration to the 100 year anniversary of Dadaism in Tokyo , the Ultra Monster was invited to meet the Swiss Ambassador Urs Bucher .

( October 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Dada in itself was relatively unknown in Russia , however , avant - garde art was widespread due to the Bolshevik 's revolutionary agenda . The Nichevoki ( ru ) , a literary group sharing Dadaist ideals achieved infamy after one of its members suggested that Vladimir Mayakovsky should go to the `` Pampushka '' ( Pameatnik Pushkina -- Pushkin monument ) on the `` Tverbul '' ( Tverskoy Boulevard ) to clean the shoes of anyone who desired it , after Mayakovsky declared that he was going to cleanse Russian literature . Poetry , music and sound ( edit ) Dada was not confined to the visual and literary arts ; its influence reached into sound and music . Kurt Schwitters developed what he called sound poems , while Francis Picabia and Georges Ribemont - Dessaignes composed Dada music performed at the Festival Dada in Paris on 26 May 1920 . Other composers such as Erwin Schulhoff , Hans Heusser and Alberto Savinio all wrote Dada music , while members of Les Six collaborated with members of the Dada movement and had their works performed at Dada gatherings . Erik Satie also dabbled with Dadaist ideas during his career , although he is primarily associated with musical Impressionism . In the very first Dada publication , Hugo Ball describes a `` balalaika orchestra playing delightful folk - songs . '' African music and jazz were common at Dada gatherings . Marc Lowenthal , in I Am a Beautiful Monster : Poetry , Prose , and Provocation , writes : Dada is the groundwork to abstract art and sound poetry , a starting point for performance art , a prelude to postmodernism , an influence on pop art , a celebration of antiart to be later embraced for anarcho - political uses in the 1960s and the movement that laid the foundation for Surrealism . Musician Frank Zappa was a self - proclaimed Dadaist after learning of the movement : In the early days , I did n't even know what to call the stuff my life was made of . You can imagine my delight when I discovered that someone in a distant land had the same idea -- AND a nice , short name for it . Legacy ( edit ) The Janco Dada Museum , named after Marcel Janco , in Ein Hod , Israel While broadly based , the movement was unstable . By 1924 in Paris , Dada was melding into Surrealism , and artists had gone on to other ideas and movements , including Surrealism , social realism and other forms of modernism . Some theorists argue that Dada was actually the beginning of postmodern art . By the dawn of the Second World War , many of the European Dadaists had emigrated to the United States . Some ( Otto Freundlich , Walter Serner ) died in death camps under Adolf Hitler , who actively persecuted the kind of `` degenerate art '' that he considered Dada to represent . The movement became less active as post-war optimism led to the development of new movements in art and literature . Dada is a named influence and reference of various anti-art and political and cultural movements , including the Situationist International and culture jamming groups like the Cacophony Society . Upon breaking up in July 2012 , anarchist pop band Chumbawamba issued a statement which compared their own legacy with that of the Dada art movement . At the same time that the Z\u00fcrich Dadaists were making noise and spectacle at the Cabaret Voltaire , Lenin was planning his revolutionary plans for Russia in a nearby apartment . Tom Stoppard used this coincidence as a premise for his play Travesties ( 1974 ) , which includes Tzara , Lenin , and James Joyce as characters . French writer Dominique Noguez imagined Lenin as a member of the Dada group in his tongue - in - cheek L\u00e9nine Dada ( 1989 ) . The former building of the Cabaret Voltaire fell into disrepair until it was occupied from January to March 2002 , by a group proclaiming themselves Neo-Dadaists , led by Mark Divo . The group included Jan Thieler , Ingo Giezendanner , Aiana Calugar , Lennie Lee , and Dan Jones . After their eviction , the space was turned into a museum dedicated to the history of Dada . The work of Lee and Jones remained on the walls of the new museum . Several notable retrospectives have examined the influence of Dada upon art and society . In 1967 , a large Dada retrospective was held in Paris . In 2006 , the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a Dada exhibition in partnership with the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. and the Centre Pompidou in Paris . The LTM label has released a large number of Dada - related sound recordings , including interviews with artists such as Tzara , Picabia , Schwitters , Arp , and Huelsenbeck , and musical repertoire including Satie , Ribemont - Dessaignes , Picabia , and Nelly van Doesburg . Art Techniques developed ( edit ) Collage ( edit ) The Dadaists imitated the techniques developed during the cubist movement through the pasting of cut pieces of paper items , but extended their art to encompass items such as transportation tickets , maps , plastic wrappers , etc. to portray aspects of life , rather than representing objects viewed as still life . Cut - up technique ( edit ) Cut - up technique is an extension of collage to words themselves , Tristan Tzara describes this in the Dada Manifesto : TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM Take a newspaper . Take some scissors . Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem . Cut out the article . Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag . Shake gently . Next take out each cutting one after the other . Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag . The poem will resemble you . And there you are -- an infinitely original author of charming sensibility , even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd . Photomontage ( edit ) The Dadaists -- the `` monteurs '' ( mechanics ) -- used scissors and glue rather than paintbrushes and paints to express their views of modern life through images presented by the media . A variation on the collage technique , photomontage utilized actual or reproductions of real photographs printed in the press . In Cologne , Max Ernst used images from the First World War to illustrate messages of the destruction of war . Raoul Hausmann , Mechanischer Kopf ( Der Geist unserer Zeit ) ( Mechanical Head ( The Spirit of Our Age ) ) , c. 1920 Raoul Hausmann , ABCD ( self - portrait ) , a photomontage from 1923 -- 24 Assemblage ( edit ) The assemblages were three - dimensional variations of the collage -- the assembly of everyday objects to produce meaningful or meaningless ( relative to the war ) pieces of work including war objects and trash . Objects were nailed , screwed or fastened together in different fashions . Assemblages could be seen in the round or could be hung on a wall . Readymades ( edit ) Marcel Duchamp began to view the manufactured objects of his collection as objects of art , which he called `` readymades '' . He would add signatures and titles to some , converting them into artwork that he called `` readymade aided '' or `` rectified readymades '' . Duchamp wrote : `` One important characteristic was the short sentence which I occasionally inscribed on the ' readymade . ' That sentence , instead of describing the object like a title , was meant to carry the mind of the spectator towards other regions more verbal . Sometimes I would add a graphic detail of presentation which in order to satisfy my craving for alliterations , would be called ' readymade aided . ' '' One such example of Duchamp 's readymade works is the urinal that was turned onto its back , signed `` R. Mutt '' , titled Fountain , and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition that year , though it was not displayed .

The film is set in 1937 rural Mississippi during the Great Depression , and its story is a modern satire loosely based on Homer 's epic poem The Odyssey that incorporates mythology from the American South . The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 film Sullivan 's Travels , in which the protagonist is a director who wants to film O Brother , Where Art Thou ? , a fictional book about the Great Depression . Much of the music used in the film is period folk music , including that of Virginia bluegrass singer Ralph Stanley . The movie was one of the first to extensively use digital color correction to give the film an autumnal , sepia - tinted look . The film received positive reviews , and the soundtrack won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2001 using American folk music . The original band became popular after the film release . The country and folk musicians who were dubbed into the film included John Hartford , Alison Krauss , Emmylou Harris , Gillian Welch , Chris Sharp , and others . They joined together to perform the music from the film in a Down from the Mountain concert tour which was filmed for TV and DVD .

The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway . He tells them , among other prophecies , that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek . The trio make their way to the house of Wash , Pete 's cousin . They sleep in the barn , but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley , who , along with his men , torches the barn . Wash 's son helps them escape . They pick up Tommy Johnson , a young black man , who claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play guitar . In need of money , the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys . That night , the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police . Unbeknownst to them , the recording becomes a major hit . Near a river , the group hears singing . They see three women washing clothes and singing . The women drug them with corn whiskey and they lose consciousness . Upon waking , Delmar finds Pete 's clothes lying next to him , empty except for a toad . Delmar is convinced the women were Sirens and transformed Pete into the toad . Later , one - eyed Bible salesman Big Dan Teague invites them for a picnic lunch , then mugs them and kills the toad . Everett and Delmar arrive in Everett 's home town . Everett confronts his wife Penny , who changed her last name and told his daughters he was dead . He gets into a fight with Vernon T. Waldrip , her new `` suitor . '' They later see Pete working on a chain gang . Later that night , they sneak into Pete 's holding cell and free him . As it turns out , the women had dragged Pete away and turned him in to the authorities . Under torture , Pete gave away the treasure 's location to the police . Everett then confesses that there is no treasure . He made it up to convince the guys he was chained with to escape with him in order to stop his wife from getting married . Pete is enraged at Everett , because he had two weeks left on his original sentence , and must serve fifty more years for the escape . The trio stumble upon a rally of the Ku Klux Klan , who are planning to hang Tommy . The trio disguise themselves as Klansmen and attempt to rescue Tommy . However , Big Dan , a Klan member , reveals their identities . Chaos ensues , and the Grand Wizard reveals himself as Homer Stokes , a candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election . The trio rush Tommy away and cut the supports of a large burning cross , leaving it to fall on Big Dan . Everett convinces Pete , Delmar and Tommy to help him win his wife back . They sneak into a Stokes campaign gala dinner she is attending , disguised as musicians . The group begins a performance of their radio hit . The crowd recognizes the song and goes wild . Homer recognizes them as the group who humiliated his mob . When he demands the group be arrested and reveals his white supremacist views , the crowd runs him out of town on a rail . Pappy O'Daniel , the incumbent candidate , seizes the opportunity , endorses the Soggy Bottom Boys and grants them full pardons . Penny agrees to marry Everett with the condition that he find her original ring . The next morning , the group sets out to retrieve the ring , which is at a cabin in the valley which Everett had earlier claimed was the location of his treasure . The police , having learned of the place from Pete , arrest the group . Dismissing their claims of having received pardons , Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged . Just as Everett prays to God , the valley is flooded and they are saved . Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by , and they return to town . However , when Everett presents the ring to Penny , it turns out it was not her ring , she does n't want that one , and she ca n't remember where she put the real ring . Cast ( edit ) George Clooney as Ulysses Everett McGill , a man who is imprisoned for practicing law without a license . He claims to have escaped from prison so he can find a stash of money he had hidden , though in reality it is so he can get back to his family before his wife remarries . He corresponds to Odysseus ( Ulysses ) in the Odyssey . John Turturro , as Pete Hogwallop , a fellow criminal who reveals little about his past . He believes in being true to one 's kin , even when his cousin Washington B. Hogwallop betrays him . He dreams of moving out west and opening a fine restaurant , where he will be the ma\u00eetre d ' . He agreed to go along with the breakout , though he only had two weeks left on his sentence . Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar O'Donnell , a small - time crook imprisoned for robbing a Piggly Wiggly in Yazoo City ; he initially claims innocence but later admits he is guilty . Delmar says he will spend his share of Everett 's nonexistent money buying back his family farm , believing , `` You ai n't no kind of man if you ai n't got land . '' Chris Thomas King as Tommy Johnson , a skilled blues musician . He is the accompanying guitarist in the Soggy Bottom Boys . He claims he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for his skill on the guitar . He shares his name and story with Tommy Johnson , a blues musician with a mysterious past , who is said to have sold his soul to the devil at the Crossroads ( a story more often attributed to Robert Johnson ) . Frank Collison as Washington B. `` Wash '' Hogwallop , Pete 's paternal cousin . He removes the escapees ' chains but later betrays the men to the police . John Goodman as Daniel `` Big Dan '' Teague , a one - eyed man who masquerades as a Bible salesman and mugs Everett and Delmar . He later reveals the identity of the trio when they are disguised at a Ku Klux Klan rally , but they kill him by cutting loose a burning cross , which falls on him and the Klansmen . He corresponds to the cyclops Polyphemus in the Odyssey . Holly Hunter as Penny , Everett 's ex-wife , who is fed up with Everett 's wheeling and dealing . She divorces him while he is in prison , telling their children he was hit by a Louisville & Nashville train . She is engaged to Vernon T. Waldrip until Everett wins her back . She corresponds to Penelope in the Odyssey . ( Penelope is an icon of the faithful wife , as she rejected her many suitors , stalling for time while awaiting Odysseus ' return . ) Charles Durning as Menelaus `` Pappy '' O'Daniel , the incumbent Governor of Mississippi . He is frequently seen berating his son and his campaign managers , who are depicted as simpletons . The character is based on Texas governor W. Lee `` Pappy '' O'Daniel . ( Flensted - Jensen elaborates on the connection between the fictional and the real Pappy O'Daniel . ) He corresponds to Menelaus in the Odyssey . Daniel von Bargen as Sheriff Cooley , a ruthless rural sheriff who , with his bloodhound , pursues the trio for the duration of the film . It is implied several times that he is the devil incarnate , and Cooley fits Tommy Johnson 's description of Satan : Cooley 's sunglasses evoke Satan 's `` big empty eyes . '' He eventually ambushes the escapees after they have been pardoned by the governor . He intends to hang them nonetheless , but when the valley is flooded , he , his men , and his dog all drown . He corresponds to Poseidon in the Odyssey . He has been compared to Boss Godfrey in Cool Hand Luke . Wayne Duvall as Homer Stokes , the reform candidate in the upcoming election for Governor . He travels the countryside with a dwarf , who depicts the `` little man '' , and a broom , with which he promises to `` sweep this state clean . '' He is secretly an Imperial Wizard in the Ku Klux Klan . He falsely identifies Everett , Pete , and Delmar as people of color because they darkened their faces to remain unseen when freeing Tommy . Ray McKinnon as Vernon T. Waldrip , Penny 's bona fide suitor and the manager of Homer Stokes 's election campaign . It has been suggested that his name is a nod to novelist Howard Waldrop , whose novella A Dozen Tough Jobs is one of the inspirations for the film . He corresponds to the Suitors of Penelope in the Odyssey . Michael Badalucco as George Nelson , a bipolar bank robber who dislikes being called `` Baby Face . '' The real George Nelson died in 1934 , three years before the story is set . Nelson died in a shootout known as the Battle of Barrington rather than by electric chair , as suggested in the film . Stephen Root as Mr. Lund , the blind radio station manager who records Everett 's story in the song `` Man of Constant Sorrow '' and makes him known throughout the state . He corresponds to Homer . Lee Weaver as the Blind Seer , a mysterious railroad man who accurately predicts the outcome of the trio 's adventure as well as several other incidents . He corresponds to Tiresias in the Odyssey . Production ( edit ) The idea of O Brother , Where Art Thou ? arose spontaneously . Work on the script began in December 1997 , long before the start of production , and was at least half - written by May 1998 . Despite the fact that Ethan Coen described the Odyssey as `` one of my favorite storyline schemes , '' neither of the brothers had read the epic and were only familiar with its content through adaptations and numerous references to the Odyssey in popular culture . According to the brothers , Nelson ( who has a degree in classics from Brown University ) was the only person on the set who had read the Odyssey . The title of the film is a reference to the 1941 Preston Sturges film Sullivan 's Travels , in which the protagonist ( a director ) wants to direct a film about the Great Depression called O Brother , Where Art Thou ? that will be a `` commentary on modern conditions , stark realism , and the problems that confront the average man . '' Lacking any experience in this area , the director sets out on a journey to experience the human suffering of the average man but is sabotaged by his anxious studio . The film has some similarity in tone to Sturges 's film , including scenes with prison gangs and a black church choir . The prisoners at the picture show scene is also a direct homage to a nearly identical scene in Sturges 's film . Joel Coen revealed in a 2000 interview that he came to Phoenix , Arizona , to offer the lead role to Clooney . Clooney agreed to do the role immediately , without reading the script . He stated that he liked even the Coens ' least successful films . Clooney did not immediately understand his character and sent the script to his uncle Jack who lived in Kentucky and asked him to read the entire script into a tape recorder . Unknown to Clooney , in his recording , Jack , a devout Baptist , omitted all instances of the words `` damn '' and `` hell '' from the Coens ' script , which only became known to Clooney after the directors pointed this out to him in the middle of shooting . This was the fourth film of the brothers in which John Turturro has starred . Other actors in O Brother , Where Art Thou ? who had worked previously with the Coens include John Goodman ( three films ) , Holly Hunter ( two ) , Michael Badalucco and Charles Durning ( one film each ) . The Coens used digital color correction to give the film a sepia - tinted look . Joel stated this was because the actual set was `` greener than Ireland . '' Cinematographer Roger Deakins stated , `` Ethan and Joel favored a dry , dusty Delta look with golden sunsets . They wanted it to look like an old hand - tinted picture , with the intensity of colors dictated by the scene and natural skin tones that were all shades of the rainbow . '' Initially the crew tried to perform the color correction using a physical process , however after several tries with various chemical processes proved unsatisfactory , it became necessary to perform the process digitally . This was the fifth film collaboration between the Coen Brothers and Deakins , and it was slated to be shot in Mississippi at a time of year when the foliage , grass , trees , and bushes would be a lush green . It was filmed near locations in Canton , Mississippi and Florence , South Carolina in the summer of 1999 . After shooting tests , including film bipack and bleach bypass techniques , Deakins suggested digital mastering be used . Deakins subsequently spent 11 weeks fine - tuning the look , mainly targeting the greens , making them a burnt yellow and desaturating the overall image in the digital files . This made it the first feature film to be entirely color corrected by digital means , narrowly beating Nick Park 's Chicken Run . O Brother , Where Art Thou ? was the first time a digital intermediate was used on the entirety of a first - run Hollywood film that otherwise had very few visual effects . The work was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite using a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution , a Pandora MegaDef to adjust the color , and a Kodak Lightning II recorder to put out to film . A major theme of the film is the connection between old - time music and political campaigning in the Southern U.S. It makes reference to the traditions , institutions , and campaign practices of bossism and political reform that defined Southern politics in the first half of the 20th century . The Ku Klux Klan , at the time a political force of white populism , is depicted burning crosses and engaging in ceremonial dance . The character Menelaus `` Pappy '' O'Daniel , the governor of Mississippi and host of the radio show The Flour Hour , is similar in name and demeanor to W. Lee `` Pappy '' O'Daniel , one - time Governor of Texas and later U.S. Senator from that state . W. Lee O'Daniel was in the flour business , and used a backing band called the Light Crust Doughboys on his radio show . In one campaign , W. Lee O'Daniel carried a broom , an oft - used campaign device in the reform era , promising to sweep away patronage and corruption . His theme song had the hook , `` Please pass the biscuits , Pappy '' , emphasizing his connection with flour . While the film borrows from real - life politics , differences are obvious between the characters in the film and historical political figures . The O'Daniel of the movie used `` You Are My Sunshine '' as his theme song ( which was originally recorded by real - life Governor of Louisiana James Houston `` Jimmie '' Davis ) and Homer Stokes , as the challenger to the incumbent O'Daniel , portrays himself as the `` reform candidate '' , using a broom as a prop . Music ( edit ) See also : O Brother , Where Art Thou ? ( soundtrack ) and Down from the Mountain Music in the film was originally conceived as a major component of the film , not merely as a background or a support . Producer and musician T - Bone Burnett worked with the Coens while the script was still in its working phases , and the soundtrack was recorded before filming commenced . Much of the music used in the film is period - specific folk music , including that of Virginia bluegrass singer Ralph Stanley . The musical selection also includes religious music , including Primitive Baptist and traditional African American gospel , most notably The Fairfield Four , an a cappella quartet with a career extending back to 1921 who appear in the soundtrack and as gravediggers towards the film 's end . Selected songs in the film reflect the possible spectrum of musical styles typical of the old culture of the American South : gospel , delta blues , country , swing and bluegrass . The use of dirges and other macabre songs is a theme that often recurs in Appalachian music ( `` O Death '' , `` Lonesome Valley '' , `` Angel Band '' , `` I Am Weary '' ) in contrast to bright , cheerful songs ( `` Keep On the Sunny Side '' , `` In the Highways '' ) in other parts of the film . The voices of the Soggy Bottom Boys were provided by Dan Tyminski ( lead vocal on `` Man of Constant Sorrow '' ) , Nashville songwriter Harley Allen , and the Nashville Bluegrass Band 's Pat Enright . The three won a CMA Award for Single of the Year and a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals , both for the song `` Man of Constant Sorrow '' . Tim Blake Nelson sang the lead vocal on `` In the Jailhouse Now '' . `` Man of Constant Sorrow '' has five variations : two are used in the film , one in the music video , and two in the soundtrack album . Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back - to - back , and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse . Though the song received little significant radio airplay , it reached # 35 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 2002 . The version of `` I 'll Fly Away '' heard in the film is performed not by Krauss and Welch ( as it is on the CD and concert tour ) , but by the Kossoy Sisters with Erik Darling accompanying on long - neck five - string banjo , recorded in 1956 for the album Bowling Green on Tradition Records . Release ( edit ) The film premiered at the AFI Film Festival on October 19 , 2000 . It grossed $71,868,327 worldwide off its $26 million budget . Critical reception ( edit ) Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 77 % based on 147 reviews and an average score of 7.1 \/ 10 . The consensus reads : `` Though not as good as Coen brothers ' classics such as Blood Simple , the delightfully loopy O Brother , Where Art Thou ? is still a lot of fun . '' The film holds an average score of 69 \/ 100 on Metacritic based on 30 reviews . Roger Ebert gave two and a half out of four stars to the film , saying all the scenes in the film were `` wonderful in their different ways , and yet I left the movie uncertain and unsatisfied '' . Accolades ( edit ) The film was selected into the main competition of the 2000 Cannes Film Festival . The film also received two Academy Award nominations at the 73rd Academy Awards : Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Cinematography . Cinematographer Roger Deakins was recognized with both Academy Award and ASC Outstanding Achievement Award nominations for his work on the film . For his portrayal of Ulysses Everett McGill , George Clooney received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor -- Motion Picture Musical or Comedy . The film was also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture -- Musical or Comedy . Soggy Bottom Boys ( edit ) The Soggy Bottom Boys is the musical group that the main characters form to serve as accompaniment for the film . The name is in homage to the Foggy Mountain Boys , a bluegrass band led by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs . In the film , the songs credited to the band are lip - synched by the actors , except that Tim Blake Nelson does sing his own vocals on `` In the Jailhouse Now . '' The actual musicians are Dan Tyminski ( guitar and lead vocals ) , Harley Allen , and Pat Enright . The band 's hit single is Dick Burnett 's `` Man of Constant Sorrow , '' a song that had already enjoyed much success in real life . After the film 's release , the fictitious band became so popular that the country and folk musicians who were dubbed into the film got together and performed the music from the film in a Down from the Mountain concert tour which was filmed for TV and DVD . This included Ralph Stanley , John Hartford , Alison Krauss , Emmylou Harris , Gillian Welch , Chris Sharp , and others . References ( edit ) ^ Jump up to : `` O Brother , Where Art Thou ? '' .

{"document_plaintext":"Negative number - wikipedia Negative number Jump to : navigation , search This thermometer is indicating a negative Fahrenheit temperature ( \u2212 4 \u00b0 F ) . In mathematics , a negative number is a real number that is less than zero . Negative numbers represent opposites . If positive represents a movement to the right , negative represents a movement to the left . If positive represents above sea level , then negative represents below sea level . If positive represents a deposit , negative represents a withdrawal . They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency . A debt that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset , a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase . If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses , then one may choose to distinguish between those senses -- perhaps arbitrarily -- as positive and negative . In the medical context of fighting a tumor , an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage . Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero , such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature . The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic . For example , \u2212 ( \u2212 3 ) = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original thing . Negative numbers are usually written with a minus sign in front . For example , \u2212 3 represents a negative quantity with a magnitude of three , and is pronounced `` minus three '' or `` negative three '' . To help tell the difference between a subtraction operation and a negative number , occasionally the negative sign is placed slightly higher than the minus sign ( as a superscript ) . Conversely , a number that is greater than zero is called positive ; zero is usually thought of as neither positive nor negative . The positivity of a number may be emphasized by placing a plus sign before it , e.g. + 3 . In general , the negativity or positivity of a number is referred to as its sign . Every real number other than zero is either positive or negative . The positive whole numbers are referred to as natural numbers , while the positive and negative whole numbers ( together with zero ) are referred to as integers . In bookkeeping , amounts owed are often represented by red numbers , or a number in parentheses , as an alternative notation to represent negative numbers . Negative numbers appeared for the first time in history in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , which in its present form dates from the period of the Chinese Han Dynasty ( 202 BC -- AD 220 ) , but may well contain much older material . Liu Hui ( c. 3rd century ) established rules for adding and subtracting negative numbers . By the 7th century , Indian mathematicians such as Brahmagupta were describing the use of negative numbers . Islamic mathematicians further developed the rules of subtracting and multiplying negative numbers and solved problems with negative coefficients . Western mathematicians accepted the idea of negative numbers by the 17th century . Prior to the concept of negative numbers , mathematicians such as Diophantus considered negative solutions to problems `` false '' and equations requiring negative solutions were described as absurd .

For example , negative three is the result of subtracting three from zero : 0 \u2212 3 = \u2212 3 . In general , the subtraction of a larger number from a smaller yields a negative result , with the magnitude of the result being the difference between the two numbers . For example , 5 \u2212 8 = \u2212 3 since 8 \u2212 5 = 3 . The number line ( edit ) Main article : Number line The relationship between negative numbers , positive numbers , and zero is often expressed in the form of a number line : Numbers appearing farther to the right on this line are greater , while numbers appearing farther to the left are less . Thus zero appears in the middle , with the positive numbers to the right and the negative numbers to the left . Note that a negative number with greater magnitude is considered less . For example , even though ( positive ) 8 is greater than ( positive ) 5 , written 8 > 5 negative 8 is considered to be less than negative 5 : \u2212 8 < \u2212 5 . ( Because , for example , if you have \u00a3 - 8 , a debt of \u00a3 8 , you would have less after adding , say \u00a3 10 , to it than if you have \u00a3 - 5 . ) It follows that any negative number is less than any positive number , so \u2212 8 < 5 and \u2212 5 < 8 . Signed numbers ( edit ) Main article : Sign ( mathematics ) In the context of negative numbers , a number that is greater than zero is referred to as positive . Thus every real number other than zero is either positive or negative , while zero itself is not considered to have a sign . Positive numbers are sometimes written with a plus sign in front , e.g. + 3 denotes a positive three . Because zero is neither positive nor negative , the term nonnegative is sometimes used to refer to a number that is either positive or zero , while nonpositive is used to refer to a number that is either negative or zero . Zero is a neutral number . Everyday uses of negative numbers ( edit ) Sport ( edit ) Goal difference in association football and hockey ; points difference in rugby football ; net run rate in cricket ; golf scores relative to par . Plus - minus differential in ice hockey : the difference in total goals scored for the team ( + ) and against the team ( \u2212 ) when a particular player is on the ice is the player 's + \/ \u2212 rating . Players can have a negative ( + \/ \u2212 ) rating . Run differential in baseball : the run differential is negative if the team allows more runs than they scored . British football clubs are deducted points if they enter administration , and thus have a negative points total until they have earned at least that many points that season . Lap ( or sector ) times in Formula 1 may be given as the difference compared to a previous lap ( or sector ) ( such as the previous record , or the lap just completed by a driver in front ) , and will be positive if slower and negative if faster . In some athletics events , such as sprint races , the hurdles , the triple jump and the long jump , the wind assistance is measured and recorded , and is positive for a tailwind and negative for a headwind . Science ( edit ) Temperatures which are colder than 0 \u00b0 C or 0 \u00b0 F . Latitudes south of the equator and longitudes west of the prime meridian . Topographical features of the earth 's surface are given a height above sea level , which can be negative ( e.g. The surface elevation of The Dead Sea or Death Valley ) . Electrical circuits . When a battery is connected in reverse polarity , the voltage applied is said to be the opposite of its rated voltage . For example , a 6 ( V ) battery connected in reverse applies a voltage of \u2212 6 ( V ) . Ions have a positive or negative electrical charge . Impedance of an AM broadcast tower used in multi-tower directional antenna arrays can have a positive or negative impedance . Finance ( edit ) Bank account balances which are overdrawn . Refunds to a credit card or debit card are a negative debit . A company might make a negative annual profit ( i.e. a loss ) . The annual percentage growth in a country 's GDP might be negative , which is one indicator of being in a recession . Occasionally , a rate of inflation may be negative ( deflation ) , indicating a fall in average prices . The daily change in a share price or stock market index , such as the FTSE 100 or the Dow Jones . A negative number in financing is synonymous with `` debt '' and `` deficit '' which are also known as `` being in the red '' . Interest rates can be negative , when the lender is charged to deposit their money . Other ( edit ) The numbering of storeys in a building below the ground floor . When playing an audio file on a portable media player , such as an iPod , the screen display may show the time remaining as a negative number , which increases up to zero at the same rate as the time already played increases from zero . Television game shows : Participants on QI often finish with a negative points score . Teams on University Challenge have a negative score if their first answers are incorrect and interrupt the question . Jeopardy ! has a negative money score -- contestants play for an amount of money and any incorrect answer that costs them more than what they have now can result in a negative score . The Price Is Right pricing game Buy or Sell , if any money is lost and is more than the amount currently in the bank , it also incurs a negative score . The change in support for a political party between elections , known as swing . A politician 's approval rating . In video games , a negative number indicates loss of life , damage , a score penalty , or consumption of a resource , depending on the genre of the simulation . Employees with flexible working hours may have a negative balance on their timesheet if they 've worked fewer total hours than contracted to that point . Employees may be able to take more than their annual holiday allowance in a year , and carry forward a negative balance to the next year . Transposing notes on an electronic keyboard are shown on the display with positive numbers for increases and negative numbers for decreases , e.g. ' \u2212 1 ' for one semitone down . Arithmetic involving negative numbers ( edit ) The minus sign `` \u2212 '' signifies the operator for both the binary ( two - operand ) operation of subtraction ( as in y \u2212 z ) and the unary ( one - operand ) operation of negation ( as in \u2212 x , or twice in \u2212 ( \u2212 x ) ) . A special case of unary negation occurs when it operates on a positive number , in which case the result is a negative number ( as in \u2212 5 ) . The ambiguity of the `` \u2212 '' symbol does not generally lead to ambiguity in arithmetical expressions , because the order of operations makes only one interpretation or the other possible for each `` \u2212 '' . However , it can lead to confusion and be difficult for a person to understand an expression when operator symbols appear adjacent to one another . A solution can be to parenthesize the unary `` \u2212 '' along with its operand . For example , the expression 7 + \u2212 5 may be clearer if written 7 + ( \u2212 5 ) ( even though they mean exactly the same thing formally ) . The subtraction expression 7 -- 5 is a different expression that does n't represent the same operations , but it evaluates to the same result . Sometimes in elementary schools a number may be prefixed by a superscript minus sign or plus sign to explicitly distinguish negative and positive numbers as in 2 + 5 gives 7 . Addition ( edit ) A visual representation of the addition of positive and negative numbers . Larger balls represent numbers with greater magnitude . Addition of two negative numbers is very similar to addition of two positive numbers . For example , ( \u2212 3 ) + ( \u2212 5 ) = \u2212 8 . The idea is that two debts can be combined into a single debt of greater magnitude . When adding together a mixture of positive and negative numbers , one can think of the negative numbers as positive quantities being subtracted . For example : 8 + ( \u2212 3 ) = 8 \u2212 3 = 5 and ( \u2212 2 ) + 7 = 7 \u2212 2 = 5 . In the first example , a credit of 8 is combined with a debt of 3 , which yields a total credit of 5 . If the negative number has greater magnitude , then the result is negative : ( \u2212 8 ) + 3 = 3 \u2212 8 = \u2212 5 and 2 + ( \u2212 7 ) = 2 \u2212 7 = \u2212 5 . Here the credit is less than the debt , so the net result is a debt . Subtraction ( edit ) As discussed above , it is possible for the subtraction of two non-negative numbers to yield a negative answer : 5 \u2212 8 = \u2212 3 In general , subtraction of a positive number yields the same result as the addition of a negative number of equal magnitude . Thus 5 \u2212 8 = 5 + ( \u2212 8 ) = \u2212 3 and ( \u2212 3 ) \u2212 5 = ( \u2212 3 ) + ( \u2212 5 ) = \u2212 8 On the other hand , subtracting a negative number yields the same result as the addition a positive number of equal magnitude . ( The idea is that losing a debt is the same thing as gaining a credit . ) Thus 3 \u2212 ( \u2212 5 ) = 3 + 5 = 8 and ( \u2212 5 ) \u2212 ( \u2212 8 ) = ( \u2212 5 ) + 8 = 3 . Multiplication ( edit ) When multiplying numbers , the magnitude of the product is always just the product of the two magnitudes . The sign of the product is determined by the following rules : The product of one positive number and one negative number is negative . The product of two negative numbers is positive . Thus ( \u2212 2 ) \u00d7 3 = \u2212 6 and ( \u2212 2 ) \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 ) = 6 . The reason behind the first example is simple : adding three \u2212 2 's together yields \u2212 6 : ( \u2212 2 ) \u00d7 3 = ( \u2212 2 ) + ( \u2212 2 ) + ( \u2212 2 ) = \u2212 6 . The reasoning behind the second example is more complicated . The idea again is that losing a debt is the same thing as gaining a credit . In this case , losing two debts of three each is the same as gaining a credit of six : ( \u2212 2 debts ) \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 each ) = + 6 credit . The convention that a product of two negative numbers is positive is also necessary for multiplication to follow the distributive law . In this case , we know that ( \u2212 2 ) \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 ) + 2 \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 ) = ( \u2212 2 + 2 ) \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 ) = 0 \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 ) = 0 . Since 2 \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 ) = \u2212 6 , the product ( \u2212 2 ) \u00d7 ( \u2212 3 ) must equal 6 . These rules lead to another ( equivalent ) rule -- the sign of any product a \u00d7 b depends on the sign of a as follows : if a is positive , then the sign of a \u00d7 b is the same as the sign of b , and if a is negative , then the sign of a \u00d7 b is the opposite of the sign of b . The justification for why the product of two negative numbers is a positive number can be observed in the analysis of complex numbers . Division ( edit ) The sign rules for division are the same as for multiplication . For example , 8 \u00f7 ( \u2212 2 ) = \u2212 4 , ( \u2212 8 ) \u00f7 2 = \u2212 4 , and ( \u2212 8 ) \u00f7 ( \u2212 2 ) = 4 . If dividend and divisor have the same sign , the result is always positive . Another method of dividing negative numbers is that if one of the numbers being divided is a negative , the answer will be negative . Negation ( edit ) Main article : Additive inverse The negative version of a positive number is referred to as its negation . For example , \u2212 3 is the negation of the positive number 3 . The sum of a number and its negation is equal to zero : 3 + ( \u2212 3 ) = 0 . That is , the negation of a positive number is the additive inverse of the number . Using algebra , we may write this principle as an algebraic identity : x + ( \u2212 x ) = 0 . This identity holds for any positive number x . It can be made to hold for all real numbers by extending the definition of negation to include zero and negative numbers . Specifically : The negation of 0 is 0 , and The negation of a negative number is the corresponding positive number . For example , the negation of \u2212 3 is + 3 . In general , \u2212 ( \u2212 x ) = x . The absolute value of a number is the non-negative number with the same magnitude . For example , the absolute value of \u2212 3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3 , and the absolute value of 0 is 0 . Formal construction of negative integers ( edit ) See also : Integer \u00a7 Construction In a similar manner to rational numbers , we can extend the natural numbers N to the integers Z by defining integers as an ordered pair of natural numbers ( a , b ) . We can extend addition and multiplication to these pairs with the following rules : ( a , b ) + ( c , d ) = ( a + c , b + d ) ( a , b ) \u00d7 ( c , d ) = ( a \u00d7 c + b \u00d7 d , a \u00d7 d + b \u00d7 c ) We define an equivalence relation ~ upon these pairs with the following rule : ( a , b ) ~ ( c , d ) if and only if a + d = b + c . This equivalence relation is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above , and we may define Z to be the quotient set N2 \/ ~ , i.e. we identify two pairs ( a , b ) and ( c , d ) if they are equivalent in the above sense . Note that Z , equipped with these operations of addition and multiplication , is a ring , and is in fact , the prototypical example of a ring . We can also define a total order on Z by writing ( a , b ) \u2264 ( c , d ) if and only if a + d \u2264 b + c . This will lead to an additive zero of the form ( a , a ) , an additive inverse of ( a , b ) of the form ( b , a ) , a multiplicative unit of the form ( a + 1 , a ) , and a definition of subtraction ( a , b ) \u2212 ( c , d ) = ( a + d , b + c ) . This construction is a special case of the Grothendieck construction . Uniqueness ( edit ) The negative of a number is unique , as is shown by the following proof . Let x be a number and let y be its negative . Suppose y \u2032 is another negative of x . By an axiom of the real number system x + y \u2032 = 0 , ( \\ displaystyle x + y \\ prime = 0 , ) x + y = 0 . ( \\ displaystyle x + y \\ , \\ , = 0 . ) And so , x + y \u2032 = x + y . Using the law of cancellation for addition , it is seen that y \u2032 = y . Thus y is equal to any other negative of x . That is , y is the unique negative of x . History ( edit ) For a long time , negative solutions to problems were considered `` false '' . In Hellenistic Egypt , the Greek mathematician Diophantus in the 3rd century AD referred to an equation that was equivalent to 4x + 20 = 4 ( which has a negative solution ) in Arithmetica , saying that the equation was absurd . Negative numbers appear for the first time in history in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art ( Jiu zhang suan - shu ) , which in its present form dates from the period of the Han Dynasty ( 202 BC -- AD 220 ) , but may well contain much older material . The mathematician Liu Hui ( c. 3rd century ) established rules for the addition and subtraction of negative numbers . The historian Jean - Claude Martzloff theorized that the importance of duality in Chinese natural philosophy made it easier for the Chinese to accept the idea of negative numbers . The Chinese were able to solve simultaneous equations involving negative numbers . The Nine Chapters used red counting rods to denote positive coefficients and black rods for negative . This system is the exact opposite of contemporary printing of positive and negative numbers in the fields of banking , accounting , and commerce , wherein red numbers denote negative values and black numbers signify positive values . Liu Hui writes : Now there are two opposite kinds of counting rods for gains and losses , let them be called positive and negative . Red counting rods are positive , black counting rods are negative . The ancient Indian Bakhshali Manuscript carried out calculations with negative numbers , using `` + '' as a negative sign . The date of the manuscript is uncertain . LV Gurjar dates it no later than the 4th century , Hoernle dates it between the third and fourth centuries , Ayyangar and Pingree dates it to the 8th or 9th centuries , and George Gheverghese Joseph dates it to about AD 400 and no later than the early 7th century , During the 7th century AD , negative numbers were used in India to represent debts . The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta , in Brahma - Sphuta - Siddhanta ( written c . AD 630 ) , discussed the use of negative numbers to produce the general form quadratic formula that remains in use today . He also found negative solutions of quadratic equations and gave rules regarding operations involving negative numbers and zero , such as `` A debt cut off from nothingness becomes a credit ; a credit cut off from nothingness becomes a debt . '' He called positive numbers `` fortunes , '' zero `` a cipher , '' and negative numbers `` debts . '' In the 9th century , Islamic mathematicians were familiar with negative numbers from the works of Indian mathematicians , but the recognition and use of negative numbers during this period remained timid . Al - Khwarizmi in his Al - jabr wa'l - muqabala ( from which we get the word `` algebra '' ) did not use negative numbers or negative coefficients . But within fifty years , Abu Kamil illustrated the rules of signs for expanding the multiplication ( a \u00b1 b ) ( c \u00b1 d ) ( \\ displaystyle ( a \\ pm b ) ( c \\ pm d ) ) , and al - Karaji wrote in his al - Fakhr\u012b that `` negative quantities must be counted as terms '' . In the 10th century , Ab\u016b al - Waf\u0101 ' al - B\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b considered debts as negative numbers in A Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen . By the 12th century , al - Karaji 's successors were to state the general rules of signs and use them to solve polynomial divisions . As al - Samaw'al writes : the product of a negative number -- al - n\u0101qi\u1e63 -- by a positive number -- al - z\u0101\u02beid -- is negative , and by a negative number is positive . If we subtract a negative number from a higher negative number , the remainder is their negative difference . The difference remains positive if we subtract a negative number from a lower negative number . If we subtract a negative number from a positive number , the remainder is their positive sum . If we subtract a positive number from an empty power ( martaba kh\u0101liyya ) , the remainder is the same negative , and if we subtract a negative number from an empty power , the remainder is the same positive number . In the 12th century in India , Bh\u0101skara II gave negative roots for quadratic equations but rejected them because they were inappropriate in the context of the problem . He stated that a negative value is `` in this case not to be taken , for it is inadequate ; people do not approve of negative roots . '' European mathematicians , for the most part , resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th century , although Fibonacci allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debits ( chapter 13 of Liber Abaci , AD 1202 ) and later as losses ( in Flos ) . In the 15th century , Nicolas Chuquet , a Frenchman , used negative numbers as exponents but referred to them as `` absurd numbers . '' In his 1544 Arithmetica Integra Michael Stifel also dealt with negative numbers , also calling them numeri absurdi . In 1545 , Gerolamo Cardano , in his Ars Magna , provided the first satisfactory treatment of negative numbers in Europe . He did not allow negative numbers in his consideration of cubic equations , so he had to treat , for example , x + ax = b separately from x = ax + b ( with a , b > 0 in both cases ) . In all , Cardano was driven to the study of thirteen different types of cubic equations , each expressed purely in terms of positive numbers . In A.D. 1759 , Francis Maseres , an English mathematician , wrote that negative numbers `` darken the very whole doctrines of the equations and make dark of the things which are in their nature excessively obvious and simple '' . He came to the conclusion that negative numbers were nonsensical . In the 18th century it was common practice to ignore any negative results derived from equations , on the assumption that they were meaningless . Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was the first mathematician to systematically employ negative numbers as part of a coherent mathematical system , the infinitesimal calculus . Calculus made negative numbers necessary and their dismissal as `` absurd numbers '' quickly faded .

Jump up ^ The convention that zero is neither positive nor negative is not universal . For example , in the French convention , zero is considered to be both positive and negative . The French words positif and n\u00e9gatif mean the same as English `` positive or zero '' and `` negative or zero '' respectively . ^ Jump up to : Struik , page 32 -- 33 . `` In these matrices we find negative numbers , which appear here for the first time in history .

Creation ( edit ) Casting ( edit ) The casting and character was announced in late May 2009 . Casey Deidrick had joined the cast as Chad . Deidrick revealed in an interview that he originally auditioned for the role of Tad . Despite very positive feedback , Brendan Coughlin was cast in the role of Tad . Deidrick 's audition caught the attention of casting director , Marnie Saitta and he was soon called back to audition for the newly created role of Chad . Deidrick tested opposite Taylor Spreitler , whom he had previously met through a mutual friend . Deidrick learned a few weeks later that he had won the role and signed the standard four - year contract . In the spring of 2013 , the series released a casting call for an actor matching Deidrick 's description which led to speculation that the role of Chad was to be recast . At the time , Deidrick 's screen time had declined dramatically and he had also booked several guest appearances in prime time . On June 20 , 2013 , Deidrick confirmed his departure from the series through Twitter and posted a picture of his final script . Deidrick 's last air date was October 30 , 2013 . Michael Fairman revealed that Deidrick made the decision to leave the series earlier that year and also hinted at the possibility of the role being recast . Deidrick told Soap Opera Digest that he would n't be opposed to a decision to recast , if it happened . However , the actor also said he was open to return to the series for future guest stints . Of his departure , Deidrick said , `` I basically wanted to pursue other opportunities . '' However , Deidrick was grateful for all he learned . In June 2014 , a picture of a script autographed by the Days of our Lives cast members was auctioned off at a charity event , and Billy Flynn was one of the signatures . On August 12 , 2014 , the producers officially announced Flynn 's casting to Soap Opera Digest ; he made his first appearance on September 12 , 2014 . In May 2018 , Flynn announced he would remain on the soap for the foreseeable future . Characterization ( edit ) Deidrick had to come up with a lot of Chad 's back story on his own because Chad was a brand new character . Deidrick initially described Chad as `` confident , edgy '' and `` mysterious . '' He is very troubled , but because he means well , it is hard to decide if one hates him or loves him . He is also very persuasive and he is not easy to break . It is obvious that he has been through a lot . Deidrick hinted that Chad may suffer from abandonment issues . Deidrick who is in a metal rock band viewed the character of Chad as a rock star and notes the similarities between the character and the genre of music . Chad has a different way of thinking which sets him apart from the average person , similar to rock stars Deidrick revealed in an interview . Chad is a `` bad boy '' with a `` care free '' spirit . Chad puts on a hard exterior and acts as if he does not care what others think of him . However , Chad has another layer to him ; he is `` very sensitive '' and all about romance which makes him all the more intriguing . Despite coming across as a bad guy , there is much more complexity to him . Development ( edit ) Introduction ( 2009 ) ( edit ) The character of Chad 's introduction would cause trouble for the romantic pairing of Will Horton ( Dylan Patton ) and Mia McCormick ( Taylor Spreitler ) . According to the actor , Chad is extremely sincere about getting custody of the baby from Nicole which is why he turns down her sexual advances . He refuses to let Mia `` whose been lying to him this whole time get in his way . '' However , Deidrick commented that when Chad turns down Nicole , he is not `` acting ( his ) age . '' Though he suspects Mia and Nicole are hiding something , Deidrick explained that Chad is completely blindsided when he finds the specifics . Of Chad 's reaction to the baby reveal Deidrick said , `` There 's nothing that can really prepare you for something like that . '' However , what hurts the most is that Chad has spent so much time trying to win Mia back , and his love for her is actually `` sincere . '' According to Deidrick , it is a `` slap in the face , '' to learn that Mia has been lying about such a huge part of their lives . For Chad , the revelation allows him to see Mia 's true colors . Deidrick stated that `` ( T ) here 's always going to be tension '' between Chad and Mia but Deidrick maintained that despite her lies , Chad feels sorry what Mia has gone through and tries to stay by her side . `` It 's a very hard situation . '' Of his character during the storyline , Deidrick described Chad as a `` kid who does n't know what to do and he 's a fighting all these feelings . '' Deidrick previewed that the reveal about the baby switch would put everything `` into place . '' The actor admitted that the baby storyline kept him very isolated due to the significant age differences between himself and the rest of his teenage costars . When asked about a future love interest , Deidrick mentioned Gabriela Rodriguez who had recently been introduced to the canvas as Gabi Hernandez ( Gabriela Rodriguez ) but did n't believe a romantic pairing would work due to the age difference . Chad 's past and paternity reveal ( 2010 ) ( edit ) In July 2009 , Chad was scripted as the son of Bill and Marsha Peterson . In June 2009 it was announced that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods . In October 2009 , the character 's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father . In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress , Jessica Tuck , known for her role as One Life to Live 's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad 's mother . Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a `` mother figure . '' Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad 's scenes with Koslow 's Kate . Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is `` completely devastated '' when she admits to being a former prostitute . Chad is fed up with his mother 's lies and just wants everything out on the table . The revelation really impacts him in an `` inexplicable '' way . Deidrick described Chad 's reaction as `` flabbergasted '' and wants to get away from her . When Chad witnesses Madeline 's fall , he freezes for a moment because he is unable to `` process '' the situation . Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up . Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent , let alone his own mother , the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes ; Deidrick 's first reaction as Chad is going into denial . Chad clings on to the little bit of courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future . According to Deidrick , the aftermath of his mother 's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little `` cuckoo crazy . '' Knowing Chad is all alone in the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline 's son with Kate 's husband , Stefano DiMera ( Joseph Mascolo ) born on March 3 , 1990 , making him a whole year older than was initially said to be . The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad 's personality . According to Deidrick , during scenes with Kate , he intentionally emphasized Chad 's vulnerabilities due to his mother 's recent death ; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment , and Kate fills that void . Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt . On the other hand , Chad 's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile . The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test . Chad has no idea how to react to the DNA results . According to Deidrick , `` ( Chad ) struggles to find the courage to be able to love ( Stefano ) who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed . '' Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct . It is all he knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away when things get difficult . However , Stefano is not easily turned away . Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline . However , he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor . Deidrick said that it was Tomlin 's idea to attach him to a main family , `` So they made ( Chad ) a DiMera . '' Friendships with Will and Sonny ( edit ) In the spring of 2011 , Entertainment Weekly announced that the series had plans for a Gay storyline with one of the current characters . There was much speculation that Chandler Massey 's Will Horton would be the character who turned out to be gay . Despite fan speculation about a romance , Chad and Will develop a great friendship . Deidrick revealed that `` Chill '' ( Chad and Will ) actually started off as a joke between himself and Massey . Deidrick admitted he would be open to the potential pairing if the writers were to go in that direction . However , the characters remain friends even after Will comes out about his sexuality . Deidrick revealed to Soaps In Depth that he was open to the story , if the writers were truly willing to take his character in that direction . Chad also develops a friendship with openly gay character , Sonny Kiriakis ( Freddie Smith ) . Their relationship is so unique , not only because of Deidrick and Smith 's real - life friendship , but also because Daytime rarely showcased a `` best friend '' type relationship between gay and straight characters . Deidrick stated that `` Chad does n't care '' about Sonny 's sexuality . Early romance with Abigail ( 2011 ) ( edit ) In January 2011 , Soap Opera Digest reported that Abigail Deveraux ( Kate Mansi ) would be Chad 's new love interest . Deidrick said he immediately connected to Mansi during her screen test . The writers teased the pairing throughout the spring of 2011 as Chad struggles to accept his new identity as a DiMera . According to Deidrick , Abigail is immediately turned off until she realizes that Chad is different from the rest of his family . Deidrick admitted that it was easy for him to work with Mansi due to the closeness in age . In an interview with TV Source Magazine from 2011 , Mansi compared Chad and Abigail 's dynamic to Romeo and Juliet . The duo shared an `` instant attraction '' but she distances herself because he is a DiMera knowing her mother Jennifer Horton ( Melissa Reeves ) does not approve . Mansi revealed that Stefano and Kate would also interfere in the romance forcing Chad and Abigail to `` fight for their relationship , '' which makes them stronger . Deidrick said challenges were inevitable due to the relationship evolving so quickly . Mansi revealed in an interview that Chad `` turns to her out of frustration from feeling the push and pull of wanting to be a part of the DiMera family but also not wanting to be apart of something that he feels is immoral . '' Deidrick explained that Chad can identify with Abigail because he also grew up with a father who neglected him which is why he and Jack do n't really see eye to eye . Jack 's disapproval of Chad 's heritage also drives a wedge between Abigail and her father as she continues to defend Chad . Romantic triangle and family troubles ( 2012 ) ( edit ) The relationship is continuously strained and matters are only made worse by Chad 's growing closeness with Melanie Jonas ( Molly Burnett ) . Deidrick said that Chad and Melanie 's kiss is accidental on the part of his character , but explains that `` Melanie makes Chad feel good , kind of like a kid , '' as opposed to Abigail who is dealing with her chaotic family life . Deidrick said that Chad is so `` love struck '' over Melanie that he does n't even notice Gabi 's feelings . On other hand , Melanie wants to maintain a friendship with Chad to keep him from hurting Abigail any further . Though the feelings were very `` unexpected , '' Chad agrees to Melanie 's wishes . When Deidrick started dating his costar Molly Burnett , the duo discussed the possibility of being paired together onscreen . Deidrick said that their real life romance helped with the portrayal of their `` real '' romance ; `` For Melanie and Chad , the backstory was already there . '' While it does n't always work for other couples , Deidrick and Burnett immediately `` clicked '' in their onscreen romance . Burnett said Melanie brings out the funnier side of Chad . As a couple , Chad and Melanie are very `` playful '' and that is how they express their love for one another . However , most of Chad and Melanie 's relationship is plagued by the schemes of Chad 's former flame , Gabi Hernandez ( Camila Banus ) who obsesses over Chad . In an interview with TV Guide , Banus explained that Gabi who is on the rebound after breaking up with Will falls for Chad after he comes to her rescue ; `` she looks at ( Chad ) as her hero . '' Though they are forced to work so closely together during their modeling career , Chad is `` oblivious '' to Gabi 's feelings . Deidrick explained that Chad only takes on the modeling gig to make Gabi 's life easier due to her split with Will . However , when it comes to romance , Chad is focused on his budding romance with Melanie . Deidrick stated : `` He cares about Gabi , but as far as he 's concerned , things are going to stay completely platonic . Gabi has no idea about Melanie , so she thinks Chad 's fair game . '' Though he wo n't admit it , Chad knows they have a chemistry during their photo shoots . The dynamic eventually develops into a triangle which leads to Gabi becoming `` very manipulative '' and a bit of a `` psycho '' in her quest for Chad 's affections . In the meantime , Chad feels pressured to embrace his family . Deidrick said that Chad `` ca n't really turn away from family . '' When Stefano and Chad 's brother , EJ DiMera ( James Scott ) have a falling out , and his sister Lexie Carver ( Ren\u00e9e Jones ) is on her death bed , Chad seems to be the only DiMera left standing . Meanwhile , Gabi 's advances start to affect Chad and it looks as if he could reciprocate those feelings . Deidrick hinted that the triangle would turn `` ugly . '' It is Lexie 's passing and Stefano 's presumed death that pushes Chad over the edge . For the first time , Deidrick allows for the character to cry . In an interview Soaps In Depth , Deidrick said that he used music to take Chad `` into the darkness . '' The actor praised the writers for allowing him to flex his acting muscles by taking Chad to such unfamiliar territory . Vendetta against Gabi ( 2012 -- 13 ) ( edit ) In August 2012 , Chad sees rescuing the kidnapped Melanie as his `` last chance for a normal life '' after the deaths of Lexie and Stefano . `` Melanie has become his family , '' Deidrick said . He described Melanie and Chad 's reunion as an `` overpowering emotion for Chad . '' When he discovers that Gabi is behind Melanie 's kidnapping , Chad is so shocked that `` He does n't really know what to do with the information . '' However , Chad rationalizes keeping Gabi 's involvement from Melanie because he `` does n't want to make things worse , '' thinking she 's been through enough . In the meantime Chad does everything to cut Gabi out of his life ; `` he pretty much exiles her , '' Deidrick said . Chad focuses all of his attention on Melanie and becomes extremely `` protective . '' Chad feels the need to shelter Melanie . However it is Chad 's lying that leads to their break . Though Chad seems overprotective , Deidrick said that Chad is overwhelmed after losing Lexie and Stefano and he reacts the way any normal person would . According to Deidrick , Chad reaches his boiling point and lashes out in anger . Chad sudden decision to ask Melanie to marry is his attempt to regain control of his life and his relationship . When she dumps him , Deidrick believed it is Chad 's compupance for trying to control everything . It takes time for Chad to sort through his feelings . Deidrick explained that Chad has dealt with just about everything since his introduction and those experiences have hardened him . After losing Melanie , Chad immediately sets his sights on revenge . However , when Chad is at the end of his rope , he has no choice but to turn to his family , which allows for the writers to develop Chad 's relationship with EJ . Deidrick relishes in Chad 's attempt to destroy Gabi 's budding romance with Nick Fallon ( Blake Berris ) . But Chad is kind of left in limbo after Burnett 's departure . Though he trusts the writers , Deidrick realized that Chad needed to make a change . And suddenly , it started , as Deidrick found ways to challenge himself by portraying Chad 's `` pain and vulnerability '' with everyone he comes in contact with . Chad has yet to understand that , `` You have to let things go , '' said Deidrick , a motto that he lives by in his personal life . Reception ( edit ) Critical ( edit ) TV Source Magazine labeled Deidrick a fan favorite and described the character of Chad as `` one of the soaps ' most popular younger characters of the late ' 00s . '' Stephanie Sloane of Soap Opera Digest commented that Chad 's paternity seemed to envelope the series , but applauded the writers for `` wisely '' connecting him to the DiMera clan . Sloane also disagreed with how long the story took to play out . She praised Deidrick for Chad 's very brief interactions with his future family members , Stefano , Kate and EJ . Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada refers to Deidrick 's performance in May 2011 as `` infectious . '' In June 2011 , Deidrick ranked at # 3 along with costar , Chandler Massey in the `` Top Young Actors to Watch '' category . In 2012 , Deidrick earned an Emmy pre-nomination in the Outstanding Younger Actor category for his portrayal of Chad . Michael Fairman applauded Deidrick for his portrayal of Chad in January 2013 when the character took revenge on Gabi and Nick , by revealing that Nick is not the father of her baby . The ratings also spiked for the episode , giving the series its highest ratings in two years . Omar Nobles praised Deidrick 's portrayal and stated : `` Deidrick 's enduring charm and emotional performances helped turn the tide in favor of the one - time bad boy '' which would lead to his popularity . Upon the announcement of Deidrick 's departure , Michael Fairman described the actor as `` one of the best young actors on daytime . '' Jamey Giddens said `` As much as I 'm going to miss the tall , drink of DiMera , I ca n't say I blame Deidrick . '' Giddens attributed the decision to Chad 's dramatic decline in screen time following Burnett 's departure . Though sad about Deidrick 's departure , Nobles said the actor had a great `` future ahead of him . '' Fairman praised Deidrick for his portrayal of Chad 's final scenes which aired on October 30 , 2013 . Relationships ( edit ) Prior to the announcement about the gay storyline fans and critics alike pushed for a romantic pairing between Chad and Will due to the chemistry between the actors . Errol Lewis of Soap Opera Network explained that the two would have great potential as a romantic pairing , due to their heritage alone ; with Chad being a DiMera , and Will being a Brady , would solidify the pairing as `` star - crossed lovers '' because of the long - standing feud between their families being staple within the series for so long . Despite both characters being involved in romantic pairings with females at the time , the pairing had already established a large fan base . The two , however , remain friends even when Will does turn out to be gay . The pairing is referred to by fans by their portmanteau `` Chill . '' Despite the joke between costars , fans immediately began pushing for the pairing . Deidrick said he would be open to the potential pairing if the writers were to go in that direction . In June 2011 , the duo ranked at # 2 in the `` Top Dream Couples '' category on TV Guide Canada 's `` Soapgeist '' . Critics praised the writers for maintaining Chad and Will 's friendship , and developing his friendship with Sonny despite both characters being gay . However , fans also pushed for a Sonny \/ Chad pairing after Chad defends him to a gay bully in September 2011 . In response Smith jokingly shot down the idea and said that Chad is a little too tall for Sonny . Greg Hernandez said it was Chad 's friendship with Will and Sonny that endeared him to the character . Fans also spoke out when Chad 's friendship with Will and Sonny started taking a back seat to other storylines . The onscreen pairing of Chad and Abigail became very popular among fans and garnered the squish name , `` Chabby '' . Jamey Giddens enjoyed Abigail and Chad 's new dynamic displayed in their snooping around Cameron . Giddens said that while he was n't a fan of their initial romance , `` Abby and Chad 's scenes were fun , and made me wish I could see more .

It quickly erodes the real value of the currency , as the prices of most or all goods increase . This causes people to minimize their holdings in that currency as they usually switch to more stable foreign currencies . Prices typically remain stable in terms of other currencies . Unlike low inflation , where the process of rising prices is protracted and not generally noticeable except by studying past market prices , hyperinflation sees a rapid and continuing increase in nominal prices , the nominal cost of goods , and in the supply of money . Typically , however , the general price level rises even more rapidly than the money supply as people try ridding themselves of the devaluing currency as quickly as possible . As this happens , the real stock of money ( i.e. , the amount of circulating money divided by the price level ) decreases considerably . Some economists believe that hyperinflations are caused by large persistent government deficits financed primarily by money creation ( rather than by borrowing or by increasing taxation ) . As such , hyperinflation is often associated with some stress to the government budget , such as wars or their aftermath , sociopolitical upheavals , a collapse in export prices , or other crises that make it difficult for the government to collect tax revenue . A sharp decrease in real tax revenue coupled with a strong need to maintain government spending , together with an inability or unwillingness to borrow , can lead a country into hyperinflation .

Bresciani - Turroni on the German hyperinflation was published in Italian in 1931 ) . In his book , Cagan defined a hyperinflationary episode as starting in the month that the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50 % , and as ending when the monthly inflation rate drops below 50 % and stays that way for at least a year . Economists usually follow Cagan 's description that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50 % . The International Accounting Standards Board has issued guidance on accounting rules in a hyperinflationary environment . It does not establish an absolute rule on when hyperinflation arises . Instead , it lists factors that indicate the existence of hyperinflation : The general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency . Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power The general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency . Prices may be quoted in that currency ; Sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period , even if the period is short ; Interest rates , wages , and prices are linked to a price index ; and The cumulative inflation rate over three years approaches , or exceeds , 100 % . Causes ( edit ) While there can be a number of causes of high inflation , most hyperinflations have been caused by government budget deficits financed by money creation . Peter Bernholz analysed 29 hyperinflations ( following Cagan 's definition ) and concludes that at least 25 of them have been caused in this way . A necessary condition for hyperinflation is the use of paper money , instead of gold or silver coins . Most hyperinflations in history , with some exceptions , such as the French hyperinflation of 1789 - 1796 , occurred after the use of fiat currency became widespread in the late 19th century . The French hyperinflation took place after the introduction of a non-convertible paper currency , the assignats . Money supply ( edit ) Hyperinflation occurs when there is a continuing ( and often accelerating ) rapid increase in the amount of money that is not supported by a corresponding growth in the output of goods and services . The price increases that result from the rapid money creation creates a vicious circle , requiring ever growing amounts of new money creation to fund government deficits . Hence both monetary inflation and price inflation proceed at a rapid pace . Such rapidly increasing prices cause widespread unwillingness of the local population to hold the local currency as it rapidly loses its buying power . Instead they quickly spend any money they receive , which increases the velocity of money flow ; this in turn causes further acceleration in prices . This means that the increase in the price level is greater than that of the money supply . The real stock of money , M \/ P , decreases . Here M refers to the money stock and P to the price level . This results in an imbalance between the supply and demand for the money ( including currency and bank deposits ) , causing rapid inflation . Very high inflation rates can result in a loss of confidence in the currency , similar to a bank run . Usually , the excessive money supply growth results from the government being either unable or unwilling to fully finance the government budget through taxation or borrowing , and instead it finances the government budget deficit through the printing of money . Governments have sometimes resorted to excessively loose monetary policy , as it allows a government to devalue its debts and reduce ( or avoid ) a tax increase . Inflation is effectively a regressive tax on the users of money , but less overt than levied taxes and is therefore harder to understand by ordinary citizens . Inflation can obscure quantitative assessments of the true cost of living , as published price indices only look at data in retrospect , so may increase only months later . Monetary inflation can become hyperinflation if monetary authorities fail to fund increasing government expenses from taxes , government debt , cost cutting , or by other means , because either during the time between recording or levying taxable transactions and collecting the taxes due , the value of the taxes collected falls in real value to a small fraction of the original taxes receivable ; or government debt issues fail to find buyers except at very deep discounts ; or a combination of the above . Theories of hyperinflation generally look for a relationship between seigniorage and the inflation tax . In both Cagan 's model and the neo-classical models , a tipping point occurs when the increase in money supply or the drop in the monetary base makes it impossible for a government to improve its financial position . Thus when fiat money is printed , government obligations that are not denominated in money increase in cost by more than the value of the money created . The price of gold in Germany , 1 January 1918 -- 30 November 1923 . ( The vertical scale is logarithmic ) . From this , it might be wondered why any rational government would engage in actions that cause or continue hyperinflation . One reason for such actions is that often the alternative to hyperinflation is either depression or military defeat . The root cause is a matter of more dispute . In both classical economics and monetarism , it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money to pay all its expenses . These models focus on the unrestrained seigniorage of the monetary authority , and the gains from the inflation tax . In neo-classical economic theory , hyperinflation is rooted in a deterioration of the monetary base , that is the confidence that there is a store of value that the currency will be able to command later . In this model , the perceived risk of holding currency rises dramatically , and sellers demand increasingly high premiums to accept the currency . This in turn leads to a greater fear that the currency will collapse , causing even higher premiums . One example of this is during periods of warfare , civil war , or intense internal conflict of other kinds : governments need to do whatever is necessary to continue fighting , since the alternative is defeat . Expenses can not be cut significantly since the main outlay is armaments . Further , a civil war may make it difficult to raise taxes or to collect existing taxes . While in peacetime the deficit is financed by selling bonds , during a war it is typically difficult and expensive to borrow , especially if the war is going poorly for the government in question . The banking authorities , whether central or not , `` monetize '' the deficit , printing money to pay for the government 's efforts to survive . The hyperinflation under the Chinese Nationalists from 1939 to 1945 is a classic example of a government printing money to pay civil war costs . By the end , currency was flown in over the Himalayas , and then old currency was flown out to be destroyed . Hyperinflation is a complex phenomenon and one explanation may not be applicable to all cases . In both of these models , however , whether loss of confidence comes first , or central bank seigniorage , the other phase is ignited . In the case of rapid expansion of the money supply , prices rise rapidly in response to the increased supply of money relative to the supply of goods and services , and in the case of loss of confidence , the monetary authority responds to the risk premiums it has to pay by `` running the printing presses . '' Nevertheless , the immense acceleration process that occurs during hyperinflation ( such as during the German hyperinflation of 1922 \/ 23 ) still remains unclear and unpredictable . The transformation of an inflationary development into the hyperinflation has to be identified as a very complex phenomenon , which could be a further advanced research avenue of the complexity economics in conjunction with research areas like mass hysteria , bandwagon effect , social brain , and mirror neurons . Supply shocks ( edit ) A number of hyperinflations were caused by some sort of extreme negative supply shock , often but not always associated with wars , the breakdown of the communist system or natural disasters . Models ( edit ) Since hyperinflation is visible as a monetary effect , models of hyperinflation center on the demand for money . Economists see both a rapid increase in the money supply and an increase in the velocity of money if the ( monetary ) inflating is not stopped . Either one , or both of these together are the root causes of inflation and hyperinflation . A dramatic increase in the velocity of money as the cause of hyperinflation is central to the `` crisis of confidence '' model of hyperinflation , where the risk premium that sellers demand for the paper currency over the nominal value grows rapidly . The second theory is that there is first a radical increase in the amount of circulating medium , which can be called the `` monetary model '' of hyperinflation . In either model , the second effect then follows from the first -- either too little confidence forcing an increase in the money supply , or too much money destroying confidence . In the confidence model , some event , or series of events , such as defeats in battle , or a run on stocks of the specie that back a currency , removes the belief that the authority issuing the money will remain solvent -- whether a bank or a government . Because people do not want to hold notes that may become valueless , they want to spend them . Sellers , realizing that there is a higher risk for the currency , demand a greater and greater premium over the original value . Under this model , the method of ending hyperinflation is to change the backing of the currency , often by issuing a completely new one . War is one commonly cited cause of crisis of confidence , particularly losing in a war , as occurred during Napoleonic Vienna , and capital flight , sometimes because of `` contagion '' is another . In this view , the increase in the circulating medium is the result of the government attempting to buy time without coming to terms with the root cause of the lack of confidence itself . In the monetary model , hyperinflation is a positive feedback cycle of rapid monetary expansion . It has the same cause as all other inflation : money - issuing bodies , central or otherwise , produce currency to pay spiraling costs , often from lax fiscal policy , or the mounting costs of warfare . When business people perceive that the issuer is committed to a policy of rapid currency expansion , they mark up prices to cover the expected decay in the currency 's value . The issuer must then accelerate its expansion to cover these prices , which pushes the currency value down even faster than before . According to this model the issuer can not `` win '' and the only solution is to abruptly stop expanding the currency . Unfortunately , the end of expansion can cause a severe financial shock to those using the currency as expectations are suddenly adjusted . This policy , combined with reductions of pensions , wages , and government outlays , formed part of the Washington consensus of the 1990s . Whatever the cause , hyperinflation involves both the supply and velocity of money . Which comes first is a matter of debate , and there may be no universal story that applies to all cases . But once the hyperinflation is established , the pattern of increasing the money stock , by whichever agencies are allowed to do so , is universal . Because this practice increases the supply of currency without any matching increase in demand for it , the price of the currency , that is the exchange rate , naturally falls relative to other currencies . Inflation becomes hyperinflation when the increase in money supply turns specific areas of pricing power into a general frenzy of spending quickly before money becomes worthless . The purchasing power of the currency drops so rapidly that holding cash for even a day is an unacceptable loss of purchasing power . As a result , no one holds currency , which increases the velocity of money , and worsens the crisis . Because rapidly rising prices undermine the role of money as a store of value , people try to spend it on real goods or services as quickly as possible . Thus , the monetary model predicts that the velocity of money will increase as a result of an excessive increase in the money supply . At the point when money velocity and prices rapidly accelerate in a vicious circle , hyperinflation is out of control , because ordinary policy mechanisms , such as increasing reserve requirements , raising interest rates , or cutting government spending will be ineffective and be responded to by shifting away from the rapidly devalued money and towards other means of exchange . During a period of hyperinflation , bank runs , loans for 24 - hour periods , switching to alternate currencies , the return to use of gold or silver or even barter become common . Many of the people who hoard gold today expect hyperinflation , and are hedging against it by holding specie . There may also be extensive capital flight or flight to a `` hard '' currency such as the US dollar . This is sometimes met with capital controls , an idea that has swung from standard , to anathema , and back into semi-respectability . All of this constitutes an economy that is operating in an `` abnormal '' way , which may lead to decreases in real production . If so , that intensifies the hyperinflation , since it means that the amount of goods in `` too much money chasing too few goods '' formulation is also reduced . This is also part of the vicious circle of hyperinflation . Once the vicious circle of hyperinflation has been ignited , dramatic policy means are almost always required . Simply raising interest rates is insufficient . Bolivia , for example , underwent a period of hyperinflation in 1985 , where prices increased 12,000 % in the space of less than a year . The government raised the price of gasoline , which it had been selling at a huge loss to quiet popular discontent , and the hyperinflation came to a halt almost immediately , since it was able to bring in hard currency by selling its oil abroad . The crisis of confidence ended , and people returned deposits to banks . The German hyperinflation ( 1919 -- November 1923 ) was ended by producing a currency based on assets loaned against by banks , called the Rentenmark . Hyperinflation often ends when a civil conflict ends with one side winning . Although wage and price controls are sometimes used to control or prevent inflation , no episode of hyperinflation has been ended by the use of price controls alone , because price controls that force merchants to sell at prices far below their restocking costs result in shortages that cause prices to rise still further . Nobel prize winner Milton Friedman said `` We economists do n't know much , but we do know how to create a shortage . If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes , for example , just pass a law that retailers ca n't sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound . Instantly you 'll have a tomato shortage . It 's the same with oil or gas . '' Effects ( edit ) Germany , 1923 : banknotes had lost so much value that they were used as wallpaper . Hyperinflation effectively wipes out the purchasing power of private and public savings ; distorts the economy in favor of the hoarding of real assets ; causes the monetary base , whether specie or hard currency , to flee the country ; and makes the afflicted area anathema to investment . One of the most important characteristics of hyperinflation is the accelerating substitution of the inflating money by stable money -- gold and silver in former times , then relatively stable foreign currencies after the breakdown of the gold or silver standards ( Thiers ' Law ) . If inflation is high enough , government regulations like heavy penalties and fines , often combined with exchange controls , can not prevent this currency substitution . As a consequence , the inflating currency is usually heavily undervalued compared to stable foreign money in terms of purchasing power parity . So foreigners can live cheaply and buy at low prices in the countries hit by high inflation . It follows that governments that do not succeed in engineering a successful currency reform in time must finally legalize the stable foreign currencies ( or , formerly , gold and silver ) that threaten to fully substitute the inflating money . Otherwise , their tax revenues , including the inflation tax , will approach zero . The last episode of hyperinflation in which this process could be observed was in Zimbabwe in the first decade of the 21st century . In this case , the local money was mainly driven out by the US dollar and the South African rand . Enactment of price controls to prevent discounting the value of paper money relative to gold , silver , hard currency , or other commodities fail to force acceptance of a paper money that lacks intrinsic value . If the entity responsible for printing a currency promotes excessive money printing , with other factors contributing a reinforcing effect , hyperinflation usually continues . Hyperinflation is generally associated with paper money , which can easily be used to increase the money supply : add more zeros to the plates and print , or even stamp old notes with new numbers . Historically , there have been numerous episodes of hyperinflation in various countries followed by a return to `` hard money '' . Older economies would revert to hard currency and barter when the circulating medium became excessively devalued , generally following a `` run '' on the store of value . Much attention on hyperinflation centers on the effect on savers whose investments become worthless . Interest rate changes often can not keep up with hyperinflation or even high inflation , certainly with contractually fixed interest rates . For example , in the 1970s in the United Kingdom inflation reached 25 % per annum , yet interest rates did not rise above 15 % -- and then only briefly -- and many fixed interest rate loans existed . Contractually , there is often no bar to a debtor clearing his long term debt with `` hyperinflated cash '' , nor could a lender simply somehow suspend the loan . Contractual `` early redemption penalties '' were ( and still are ) often based on a penalty of n months of interest \/ payment ; again no real bar to paying off what had been a large loan . In interwar Germany , for example , much private and corporate debt was effectively wiped out -- certainly for those holding fixed interest rate loans . Ludwig von Mises used the term `` crack - up boom '' ( German : Katastrophenhausse ) to describe the economic consequences of an unmitigated increasing in the base - money supply . As more and more money is provided , interest rates decline towards zero . Realizing that fiat money is losing value , investors will try to place money in assets such as real estate , stocks , even art ; as these appear to represent `` real '' value . Asset prices are thus becoming inflated . This potentially spiraling process will ultimately lead to the collapse of the monetary system . The Cantillon effect says that those institutions that receive the new money first are the beneficiaries of the policy . Aftermath ( edit ) Hyperinflation is ended by drastic remedies , such as imposing the shock therapy of slashing government expenditures or altering the currency basis . One form this may take is dollarization , the use of a foreign currency ( not necessarily the U.S. dollar ) as a national unit of currency . An example was dollarization in Ecuador , initiated in September 2000 in response to a 75 % loss of value of the Ecuadorian sucre in early 2000 . But usually the `` dollarization '' takes place in spite of all efforts of the government to prevent it by exchange controls , heavy fines and penalties . The government has thus to try to engineer a successful currency reform stabilizing the value of the money . If it does not succeed with this reform the substitution of the inflating by stable money goes on . Thus it is not surprising that there have been at least seven historical cases in which the good ( foreign ) money did fully drive out the use of the inflating currency . In the end the government had to legalize the former , for otherwise its revenues would have fallen to zero . Hyperinflation has always been a traumatic experience for the people who suffer it , and the next political regime almost always enacts policies to try to prevent its recurrence . Often this means making the central bank very aggressive about maintaining price stability , as was the case with the German Bundesbank , or moving to some hard basis of currency , such as a currency board . Many governments have enacted extremely stiff wage and price controls in the wake of hyperinflation , but this does not prevent further inflation of the money supply by the central bank , and always leads to widespread shortages of consumer goods if the controls are rigidly enforced . Currency ( edit ) In countries experiencing hyperinflation , the central bank often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless . This can result in the production of unusually large demoninations of banknotes , including those denominated in amounts of 1,000,000,000 or more . By late 1923 , the Weimar Republic of Germany was issuing two - trillion mark banknotes and postage stamps with a face value of fifty billion marks . The highest value banknote issued by the Weimar government 's Reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion marks ( 10 ; 100,000,000,000,000 ; 100 million million ) . At the height of the inflation , one US dollar was worth 4 trillion German marks . One of the firms printing these notes submitted an invoice for the work to the Reichsbank for 32,776,899,763,734,490,417.05 ( 3.28 \u00d7 10 , or 33 quintillion ) marks . The largest denomination banknote ever officially issued for circulation was in 1946 by the Hungarian National Bank for the amount of 100 quintillion peng\u0151 ( 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 , or 10 ; 100 million million million ) image . ( A banknote worth 10 times as much , 10 ( 1 sextillion ) peng\u0151 , was printed but not issued image . ) The banknotes did not show the numbers in full : `` hundred million b. - peng\u0151 '' ( `` hundred million trillion peng\u0151 '' ) and `` one milliard b. - peng\u0151 '' were spelled out instead . This makes the 100,000,000,000,000 Zimbabwean dollar banknotes the note with the greatest number of zeros shown . The Post-World War II hyperinflation of Hungary held the record for the most extreme monthly inflation rate ever -- 41,900,000,000,000,000 % ( 4.19 \u00d7 10 % or 41.9 quadrillion percent ) for July 1946 , amounting to prices doubling every 15.3 hours . By comparison , recent figures ( as of 14 November 2008 ) estimate Zimbabwe 's annual inflation rate at 89.7 sextillion ( 10 ) percent . The highest monthly inflation rate of that period was 79.6 billion percent , and a doubling time of 24.7 hours . In figures , that is 79,600,000,000 % . One way to avoid the use of large numbers is by declaring a new unit of currency . ( As an example , instead of 10,000,000,000 dollars , a central bank might set 1 new dollar = 1,000,000,000 old dollars , so the new note would read `` 10 new dollars '' . ) A recent example of this is Turkey 's revaluation of the Lira on 1 January 2005 , when the old Turkish lira ( TRL ) was converted to the New Turkish lira ( TRY ) at a rate of 1,000,000 old to 1 new Turkish Lira . While this does not lessen the actual value of a currency , it is called redenomination or revaluation and also occasionally happens in countries with lower inflation rates . During hyperinflation , currency inflation happens so quickly that bills reach large numbers before revaluation . Some banknotes were stamped to indicate changes of denomination , as it would have taken too long to print new notes . By the time new notes were printed , they would be obsolete ( that is , they would be of too low a denomination to be useful ) . Metallic coins were rapid casualties of hyperinflation , as the scrap value of metal enormously exceeded its face value . Massive amounts of coinage were melted down , usually illicitly , and exported for hard currency . Governments will often try to disguise the true rate of inflation through a variety of techniques . None of these actions addresses the root causes of inflation ; and if discovered , they tend to further undermine trust in the currency , causing further increases in inflation . Price controls will generally result in shortages and hoarding and extremely high demand for the controlled goods , causing disruptions of supply chains . Products available to consumers may diminish or disappear as businesses no longer find it economic to continue producing and \/ or distributing such goods at the legal prices , further exacerbating the shortages . There are also issues with computerized money - handling systems . In Zimbabwe , during the hyperinflation of the Zimbabwe dollar , many automated teller machines and payment card machines struggled with arithmetic overflow errors as customers required many billions and trillions of dollars at one time . Notable hyperinflationary episodes ( edit ) Rome ( edit ) During the Crisis of the Third Century , Rome underwent hyperinflation caused by years of coinage devaluation . Austria ( edit ) Hanke Krus Hyperinflation Table that lists 56 episodes of hyperinflation ( following Cagan 's definition ) In 1922 , inflation in Austria reached 1,426 % , and from 1914 to January 1923 , the consumer price index rose by a factor of 11,836 , with the highest banknote in denominations of 500,000 Austrian krones . After World War I , essentially all State enterprises ran at a loss , and the number of state employees in the capital , Vienna , was greater than in the earlier monarchy , even though the new republic was nearly one - eighth of the size . Observing the Austrian response to developing hyperinflation , which included the hoarding of food and the speculation in foreign currencies , Owen S. Phillpotts , the Commercial Secretary at the British Legation in Vienna wrote : `` The Austrians are like men on a ship who can not manage it , and are continually signalling for help . While waiting , however , most of them begin to cut rafts , each for himself , out of the sides and decks . The ship has not yet sunk despite the leaks so caused , and those who have acquired stores of wood in this way may use them to cook their food , while the more seamanlike look on cold and hungry . The population lack courage and energy as well as patriotism . '' Start and End Date : Oct. 1921 -- Sep. 1922 Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Aug. 1922 , 129 % China ( edit ) As the first user of fiat currency , China was also the first country to experience hyperinflation . Paper currency was introduced during the Tang Dynasty , and was generally welcomed . It maintained its value , as successive Chinese governments put in place strict controls on issuance . The convenience of paper currency for trade purposes led to strong demand for paper currency . It was only when discipline on quantity supplied broke down that hyperinflation emerged . The Yuan Dynasty ( 1271 -- 1368 ) was the first to print large amounts of fiat paper money to fund their wars , resulting in hyperinflation . Much later , the Republic of China went through hyperinflation from 1948 -- 49 . In 1947 , the highest denomination bill was 50,000 yuan . By mid-1948 , the highest denomination was 180,000,000 yuan . The 1948 currency reform replaced the yuan by the gold yuan at an exchange rate of 1 gold yuan = 3,000,000 yuan . In less than a year , the highest denomination was 10,000,000 gold yuan . In the final days of the civil war , the Silver Yuan was briefly introduced at the rate of 500,000,000 Gold Yuan . Meanwhile , the highest denomination issued by a regional bank was 6,000,000,000 yuan ( issued by Xinjiang Provincial Bank in 1949 ) . After the renminbi was instituted by the new communist government , hyperinflation ceased , with a revaluation of 1 : 10,000 old Renminbi in 1955 .

May 1949 ( 2 ) Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Apr 5,070 % France ( edit ) During the French Revolution and first Republic , the National Assembly issued bonds , some backed by seized church property , called assignats . Napoleon replaced them with the franc in 1803 , at which time the assignats were basically worthless . Stephen D. Dillaye pointed out that one of the reasons for the failure was massive counterfeiting of the paper currency , `` the Assignats '' -- largely through London -- where , according to Dillaye : `` Seventeen manufacturing establishments were in full operation in London , with a force of four hundred men devoted to the production of false and forged Assignats . '' Start and End Date : May 1795 -- Nov. 1796 Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Mid-Aug. 1796 , 304 % Germany ( Weimar Republic ) ( edit ) Main article : Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic 5 Million Mark coin would have been worth $714.29 in Jan 1923 , about 1 thousandth of one cent by Oct 1923 . By November 1922 , the value in gold of money in circulation had fallen from \u00a3 300 million before World War I to \u00a3 20 million . The Reichsbank responded by the unlimited printing of notes , thereby accelerating the devaluation of the mark . In his report to London , Lord D'Abernon wrote : `` In the whole course of history , no dog has ever run after its own tail with the speed of the Reichsbank . '' Germany went through its worst inflation in 1923 . In 1922 , the highest denomination was 50,000 Marks . By 1923 , the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 ( 10 ) Marks . In December 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000 ( 4.2 \u00d7 10 ) Marks to 1 US dollar . In 1923 , the rate of inflation hit 3.25 \u00d7 10 percent per month ( prices double every two days ) . Beginning on 20 November 1923 , 1,000,000,000,000 old Marks were exchanged for 1 Rentenmark , so that 4.2 Rentenmarks were worth 1 US dollar , exactly the same rate the Mark had in 1914 .

This was due to psychological factors related to the fear of shortages and to the hoarding of goods . During the German and Italian Axis occupation of Greece ( 1941 - 1944 ) , the agricultural , mineral , industrial etc. production of Greece were used to sustain the occupation forces , but also to secure provisions for the Afrika Korps . One part of these `` sales '' of provisions was settled with bilateral clearing through the German DEGRIGES and the Italian Sagic companies at very low prices . As the value of Greek exports in drachmas fell , the demand for drachmas followed suit and so did its forex rate . While shortages started due to naval blockades and hoarding , the prices of commodities soared . The other part of the `` purchases '' was settled with drachmas secured from the Bank of Greece and printed for this purpose by private printing presses . As prices soared , the Germans and Italians started requesting more and more drachmas from the Bank of Greece to offset price increases ; each time prices increased , the note circulation followed suit soon afterwards . For the year November 1943 - November 1944 , the inflation rate was 2.5 \u00d7 10 % , the circulation was 6.28 \u00d7 10 drachmae and one gold sovereign cost 43,167 billion drachmas . The hyperinflation started subsiding immediately after the departure of the German occupation forces , but inflation rates took several years before they fell below 50 % . Start and End Date : Jun. 1941 -- Jan. 1946 Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Dec. 1944 , 3.0 \u00d7 10 % Hungary ( edit ) Main article : Hungarian peng\u0151 hyperinflation The 100 million b. - peng\u0151 note was the highest denomination of banknote ever issued , worth 10 or 100 quintillion Hungarian peng\u0151 ( 1946 ) . B. - peng\u0151 was short for `` billi\u00f3 peng\u0151 '' , i.e. 10 peng\u0151 . The Treaty of Trianon and political instability between 1919 and 1924 led to a major inflation of Hungary 's currency . In 1921 , in an attempt to stop inflation , the national assembly of Hungary passed the Heged\u0171s reforms , including a 20 % levy on bank deposits . This action precipitated a mistrust of banks by the public , especially the peasants , and resulted in a reduction in savings and in the amount of currency in circulation . Unable to tax adequately , the government resorted to printing money , and in 1923 inflation in Hungary reached 98 % per month . Between the end of 1945 and July 1946 , Hungary went through the worst inflation ever recorded . In 1944 , the highest denomination was 1,000 peng\u0151 . By the end of 1945 , it was 10,000,000 peng\u0151 . The highest denomination in mid-1946 was 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 ( 10 ) peng\u0151 . A special currency , the ad\u00f3peng\u0151 -- or tax peng\u0151 -- was created for tax and postal payments . The value of the ad\u00f3peng\u0151 was adjusted each day , by radio announcement . On 1 January 1946 one ad\u00f3peng\u0151 equaled one peng\u0151 . By late July , one ad\u00f3peng\u0151 equaled 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 2 \u00d7 10 ( 2 sextillion ) peng\u0151 . When the peng\u0151 was replaced in August 1946 by the forint , the total value of all Hungarian banknotes in circulation amounted to \/ of one US dollar . This is the most severe known incident of inflation recorded , peaking at 1.3 \u00d7 10 percent per month ( prices double every 15 hours ) . The overall impact of hyperinflation : On 18 August 1946 , 400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or 4 \u00d7 10 ( four hundred quadrilliard on the long scale used in Hungary ; four hundred octillion on short scale ) peng\u0151 became 1 forint . Start and End Date : Aug. 1945 -- Jul. 1946 Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Jul. 1946 , 41.9 quadrillion percent North Korea ( edit ) North Korea has most likely experienced hyperinflation from December 2009 to mid-January 2011 . Based on the price of rice , North Korea 's hyperinflation peaked in mid-January 2010 , but according to black market exchange - rate data , and calculations based on purchasing power parity , North Korea experienced its peak month of inflation in early March 2010 . These data are unofficial , however , and therefore must be treated with a degree of caution . Peru ( edit ) In modern history , Peru has underwent a hyperinflation period ranging from the 1980s to the early 1990s starting with President Fernando Belaunde 's second administration , heightening during Alan Garcia 's first administration , to the beginning of Alberto Fujimori 's term . Over 3,210,000,000 old soles would be worth one USD . Garcia 's term introduced the inti , which worsened the inflation into hyperinflation . Peru 's currency and economy was pacified under Fujimori 's Nuevo Sol program , which remains as Peru 's currency . Poland ( edit ) Poland has gone through two episodes of hyperinflation since the country regained independence following the first world war : the first one in 1923 , the second one in 1989 - 1990 . Both of these events resulted in introduction of new currencies . In 1924 , the z\u0142oty replaced the original currency of post-war Poland , the mark . The currency was then replaced by a new one of the same name in 1950 , which was assigned the ISO code of PLZ . As a result of the second hyperinflation crisis , the current new z\u0142oty was introduced in 1990 ( ISO code : PLN ) . See the article on Polish z\u0142oty for more information about the currency 's history . The newly independent Poland had been struggling with a large budget deficit since its inception in 1918 but it was in 1923 when inflation reached its peak . The exchange rate to the American dollar went up from 9 Polish marks for a dollar in 1918 to 6,375,000 marks per dollar at the end of 1923 . A new personal ' inflation tax ' was introduced . The resolution of the crisis is attributed to the person of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski , who became the prime minister of Poland in December 1923 . Having nominated an all - new government and been granted extraordinary lawmaking powers by the Sejm for a period of six months , he went on to introduce a new currency , establish a new national bank and scrap the inflation tax , which took place throughout 1924 . The economic crisis in Poland in 1980s was accompanied by rising inflation when new money was printed to cover a budget deficit . Although the inflation was not as acute as in 1920s , it is estimated that its annual rate reached around 600 % in a period of over a year spanning parts of 1989 and 1990 . The economy was stabilised by the adoption of the Balcerowicz Plan in 1989 , named so after the main author of the reforms , the minister of finance Leszek Balcerowicz . The plan was largely inspired by the previous Grabski 's reforms . Philippines ( edit ) The Japanese government occupying the Philippines during World War II issued fiat currencies for general circulation . The Japanese - sponsored Second Philippine Republic government led by Jose P. Laurel at the same time outlawed possession of other currencies , most especially `` guerilla money . '' The fiat money 's lack of value earned it the derisive nickname `` Mickey Mouse money '' . Survivors of the war often tell tales of bringing suitcase or bayong ( native bags made of woven coconut or buri leaf strips ) overflowing with Japanese - issued bills . In the early times , 75 Mickey Mouse pesos could buy one duck egg . In 1944 , a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos . In 1942 , the highest denomination available was 10 pesos . Before the end of the war , because of inflation , the Japanese government was forced to issue 100 , 500 , and 1000 peso notes . Start and End Date : Jan. 1944 -- Dec. 1944 Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Jan. 1944 , 60 % British Malaya ( edit ) Banana banknotes issued by the Japanese Government during the occupation of Malaya . The term `` banana money '' originates from the motifs of banana trees on the currency 's 10 dollar banknote . Malaya and Singapore were under Japanese occupation from 1942 until 1945 . The Japanese issued banana money as the official currency to replace the Straits currency issued by the British . During that time , the cost of basic necessities increased drastically . As the occupation proceeded , the Japanese authorities printed more money to fund their wartime activities , which resulted in hyperinflation and a severe depreciation in value of the banana note . From February to December 1942 , $100 of Straits currency was worth $100 in Japanese scrip , after which the value of Japanese scrip began to erode , reaching $385 on December 1943 and $1,850 one year later . By 1 August 1945 , this had inflated to $10,500 , and 11 days later it had reached $95,000 . After 13 August 1945 , Japanese scrip had become valueless . Soviet Union ( edit ) Main article : Hyperinflation in early Soviet Russia A seven - year period of uncontrollable spiralling inflation occurred in the early Soviet Union , running from the earliest days of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917 to the reestablishment of the gold standard with the introduction of the chervonets as part of the New Economic Policy . The inflationary crisis effectively ended in March 1924 with the introduction of the so - called `` gold ruble '' as the country 's standard currency . The early Soviet hyperinflationary period was marked by three successive redenominations of its currency , in which `` new rubles '' replaced old at the rates of 10,000 - to - 1 ( 1 January 1922 ) , 100 - to - 1 ( 1 January 1923 ) , and 50,000 - to - 1 ( 7 March 1924 ) , respectively . Between 1921 and 1922 , inflation in the Soviet Union reached 213 % . Venezuela ( edit ) Main article : Crisis in Venezuela The value of one US dollar in Venezuelan Bolivares fuertes on the black market through time , according to DolarToday.com . Blue vertical lines represent every time the currency has lost 90 % of its value . This has happened five times since 2012 , meaning that the currency is worth , as of June 2018 , 100,000 times less than in August 2012 , since it has lost more than 99.999 % of its value . Venezuela 's hyperinflation began in November 2016 . Inflation of Venezuela 's bolivar fuerte ( VEF ) in 2014 reached 69 % and was the highest in the world . In 2015 , inflation was 181 % , the highest in the world and the highest in the country 's history at that time , 800 % in 2016 and over 4,000 % in 2017 , with Venezuela spiraling into hyperinflation . While the Venezuelan government `` has essentially stopped '' producing official inflation estimates as of early 2018 , one estimation of the rate at that time was 5,220 % , according to inflation economist Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University . Inflation has affected Venezuelans so much that in 2017 , some people became video game gold farmers and could be seen playing games such as RuneScape to sell in - game currency or characters for real currency . In many cases , these gamers made more money than salaried workers in Venezuela even though they were earning just a few dollars per day . In the Christmas season of 2017 , some shops would no longer use price tags since prices would inflate so quickly , so customers were required to ask staff at stores how much each item was . The International Monetary Fund estimated in 2018 that Venezuela 's inflation rate would reach 1,000,000 % by the end of the year. . This forecast was criticized by Steve H. Hanke , professor of applied economics at The Johns Hopkins University and senior fellow at the Cato Institute . According to Hanke , the IMF had released a `` bogus forecast '' because `` no one has ever been able to accurately forecast the course or the duration of an episode of hyperinflation . But , that has n't stopped the IMF from offering up inflation forecasts for Venezuela that have proven to be wildly inaccurate '' . In July 2018 , Hyperinflation in Venezuela was sitting 33,151 % , `` the 23rd most severe episode of hyperinflation in history '' . Start and End Date : Nov. 2016 -- ongoing Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Apr. 2018 , 234 % Yugoslavia ( edit ) A 500 billion Yugoslav dinar banknote circa 1993 , the largest nominal value ever officially printed in Yugoslavia , the final result of hyperinflation . Yugoslavia went through a period of hyperinflation and subsequent currency reforms from 1989 -- 1994 . One of several regional conflicts accompanying the dissolution of Yugoslavia was the Bosnian War ( 1992 -- 1995 ) . The Belgrade government of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 backed ethnic Serbian secessionist forces in the conflict , resulting in a United Nations boycott of Yugoslavia . The UN boycott collapsed an economy already weakened by regional war , with the projected monthly inflation rate accelerating to one million percent by December 1993 ( prices double every 2.3 days ) . The highest denomination in 1988 was 50,000 dinars . By 1989 it was 2,000,000 dinars . In the 1990 currency reform , 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10,000 old dinars . In the 1992 currency reform , 1 new dinar was exchanged for 10 old dinars . The highest denomination in 1992 was 50,000 dinars . By 1993 , it was 10,000,000,000 dinars . In the 1993 currency reform , 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000 old dinars . Before the year was over , however , the highest denomination was 500,000,000,000 dinars . In the 1994 currency reform , 1 new dinar was exchanged for 1,000,000,000 old dinars . In another currency reform a month later , 1 novi dinar was exchanged for 13 million dinars ( 1 novi dinar = 1 German mark at the time of exchange ) . The overall impact of hyperinflation was that 1 novi dinar was equal to 1 \u00d7 10 ~ 1.3 \u00d7 10 pre-1990 dinars . Yugoslavia 's rate of inflation hit 5 \u00d7 10 percent cumulative inflation over the time period 1 October 1993 and 24 January 1994 .

Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe was one of the few instances that resulted in the abandonment of the local currency . At independence in 1980 , the Zimbabwe dollar ( ZWD ) was worth about USD 1.25 . Afterwards , however , rampant inflation and the collapse of the economy severely devalued the currency . Inflation was steady until British Prime Minister Tony Blair reneged on Land reform agreements arrived at between Margaret Thatcher and Robert Mugabe continued land redistribution from the white farming community in 1998 , resulting in reductions in food production and the decline of foreign investment . Several multinational companies began hoarding of retail goods in warehouses in Zimbabwe and just south of the border , preventing commodities becoming available on the market The result was that to pay its expenditures Mugabe 's government and Gideon Gono 's Reserve Bank printed more and more notes with higher face values . Hyperinflation began early in the 21st century , reaching 624 % in 2004 . It fell back to low triple digits before surging to a new high of 1,730 % in 2006 . The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe revalued on 1 August 2006 at a ratio of 1,000 ZWD to each second dollar ( ZWN ) , but year - to - year inflation rose by June 2007 to 11,000 % ( versus an earlier estimate of 9,000 % ) . Larger denominations were progressively issued in 2008 : 5 May : banknotes or `` bearer cheques '' for the value of ZWN 100 million and ZWN 250 million . 15 May : new bearer cheques with a value of ZWN 500 million ( then equivalent to about USD 2.50 ) . 20 May : a new series of notes ( `` agro cheques '' ) in denominations of $5 billion , $25 billion and $50 billion . 21 July : `` agro cheque '' for $100 billion . Inflation by 16 July officially surged to 2,200,000 % with some analysts estimating figures surpassing 9,000,000 % . As of 22 July 2008 the value of the ZWN fell to approximately 688 billion per 1 USD , or 688 trillion pre-August 2006 Zimbabwean dollars . Date of redenomination Currency code Value 1 August 2006 ZWN 1 000 ZWD 1 August 2008 ZWR 10 ZWN = 10 ZWD 2 February 2009 ZWL 10 ZWR = 10 ZWN = 10 ZWD On 1 August 2008 , the Zimbabwe dollar was redenominated at the ratio of 10 ZWN to each third dollar ( ZWR ) . On 19 August 2008 , official figures announced for June estimated the inflation over 11,250,000 % . Zimbabwe 's annual inflation was 231,000,000 % in July ( prices doubling every 17.3 days ) . By October 2008 Zimbabwe was mired in hyperinflation with wages falling far behind inflation . In this dysfunctional economy hospitals and schools had chronic staffing problems , because many nurses and teachers could not afford bus fare to work . Most of the capital of Harare was without water because the authorities had stopped paying the bills to buy and transport the treatment chemicals . Desperate for foreign currency to keep the government functioning , Zimbabwe 's central bank governor , Gideon Gono , sent runners into the streets with suitcases of Zimbabwean dollars to buy up American dollars and South African rand . For periods after July 2008 , no official inflation statistics were released . Prof. Steve H. Hanke overcame the problem by estimating inflation rates after July 2008 and publishing the Hanke Hyperinflation Index for Zimbabwe . Prof. Hanke 's HHIZ measure indicated that the inflation peaked at an annual rate of 89.7 sextillion percent ( 89,700,000,000,000,000,000,000 % ) in mid-November 2008 . The peak monthly rate was 79.6 billion percent , which is equivalent to a 98 % daily rate , or around 7 \u00d7 10 ^ percent yearly rate . At that rate , prices were doubling every 24.7 hours . Note that many of these figures should be considered mostly theoretic , since the hyperinflation did not proceed at that rate a whole year . At its November 2008 peak , Zimbabwe 's rate of inflation approached , but failed to surpass , Hungary 's July 1946 world record . On 2 February 2009 , the dollar was redenominated for the third time at the ratio of 10 ZWR to 1 ZWL , only three weeks after the $100 trillion banknote was issued on 16 January , but hyperinflation waned by then as official inflation rates in USD were announced and foreign transactions were legalised , and on 12 April the Zimbabwe dollar was abandoned in favour of using only foreign currencies . The overall impact of hyperinflation was 1 ZWL = 10 ZWD . Start and End Date : Mar. 2007 -- Mid-Nov. 2008 Peak Month and Rate of Inflation : Mid-Nov. 2008 , 79.6 billion percent Examples of high inflation ( edit ) Some countries experienced very high inflation , but did not reach hyperinflation , as defined as a monthly inflation rate of 50 % . Holy Roman empire ( edit ) Main article : Kipper und Wipper Between 1620 and 1622 the Kreuzer fell from 1 Reichsthaler to 124 Kreuzer in end of 1619 to 1 Reichstaler to over 600 ( regionally over 1000 ) Kreuzer in end of 1622 , during the Thirty Years ' War . This is a monthly inflation rate of over 20.6 % ( regionally over 34.4 % ) . Iraq ( edit ) Between 1987 and 1995 the Iraqi Dinar went from an official value of 0.306 Dinars \/ USD ( or $3.26 USD per dinar , though the black market rate is thought to have been substantially lower ) to 3,000 Dinars \/ USD due to government printing of 10s of trillions of dinars starting with a base of only 10s of billions . That equates to approximately 315 % inflation per year averaged over that eight - year period . Mexico ( edit ) In spite of increased oil prices in the late 1970s ( Mexico is a producer and exporter ) , Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982 . As a result , the country suffered a severe case of capital flight and several years of acute inflation and peso devaluation , leading to an accumulated inflation rate of almost 27,000 % between December 1975 and late 1988 . On 1 January 1993 , Mexico created a new currency , the nuevo peso ( `` new peso '' , or MXN ) , which chopped three zeros off the old peso ( One new peso was equal to 1,000 old MXP pesos ) . Roman Egypt ( edit ) In Roman Egypt , where the best documentation on pricing has survived , the price of a measure of wheat was 200 drachmae in 276 AD , and increased to more than 2,000,000 drachmae in 334 AD , roughly 1,000,000 % inflation in a span of 58 years . Although the price increased by a factor of 10,000 over 58 years , the annual rate of inflation was only 17.2 % ( 1.4 % monthly ) compounded . Romania ( edit ) Romania experienced high inflation in the 1990s . The highest denomination in 1990 was 100 lei and in 1998 was 100,000 lei . By 2000 it was 500,000 lei . In early 2005 it was 1,000,000 lei . In July 2005 the lei was replaced by the new leu at 10,000 old lei = 1 new leu . Inflation in 2005 was 9 % . In July 2005 the highest denomination became 500 lei ( = 5,000,000 old lei ) . Transnistria ( edit ) The Second Transnistrian ruble consisted solely of banknotes and suffered from high inflation , necessitating the issue of notes overstamped with higher denominations . 1 and sometimes 10 ruble become 10,000 ruble , 5 ruble become 50,000 and 10 ruble become 100,000 ruble . In 2000 , a new ruble was introduced at a rate of 1 new ruble = 1,000,000 old rubles . Turkey ( edit ) Main article : Turkish currency and debt crisis , 2018 Since the end of 2017 has high inflation rates . It is speculated that the new elections took place frustrated because of the impending crisis to forestall . In October 2017 , inflation was at 11.9 % , the highest rate since July 2008 . The Turkish Lira fall from 1.503 TRY = 1 US - Dollar in 2010 to 5.5695 TRY = 1 US - Dollar in August 2018 . United states ( edit ) During the Revolutionary War , when the Continental Congress authorized the printing of paper called continental currency , the monthly inflation rate reached a peak of 47 percent in November 1779 ( Bernholz 2003 : 48 ) . These notes depreciated rapidly , giving rise to the expression `` not worth a continental . '' One cause of the inflation was counterfeiting by the British , who ran a press on HMS Phoenix , moored in New York Harbour . The counterfeits were advertised and sold almost for the price of the paper they were printed on . A second close encounter occurred during the U.S. Civil War , between January 1861 and April 1865 , the Lerner Commodity Price Index of leading cities in the eastern Confederacy states increased from 100 to over 9,000 . As the Civil War dragged on , the Confederate dollar had less and less value , until it was almost worthless by the last few months of the war . Similarly , the Union government inflated its greenbacks , with the monthly rate peaking at 40 percent in March 1864 ( Bernholz 2003 : 107 ) . Vietnam ( edit ) Vietnam went through a period of chaos and hyperinflation in the late 1980s , with inflation peaking at 774 % in 1988 , after the country 's `` price - wage - currency '' reform package , led by then - Deputy Prime Minister Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng , had failed . Hyperinflation also occurred in the early stages of the socialist - oriented market economic reforms commonly referred to as the \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi .

It can be read from the table that if the ( annual ) inflation is for example 100 % , it takes 3.32 years to produce one more zero on the price tags , or 3 \u00d7 3.32 = 9.96 years to produce three zeroes . Thus can one expect a redenomination to take place about 9.96 years after the currency was introduced .

Standing 4,207 m ( 13,802 ft ) above sea level , its peak is the highest point in the state of Hawaii . Much of the mountain is under water ; when measured from its oceanic base , Mauna Kea is over 10,000 m ( 33,000 ft ) tall and is the tallest mountain on Earth . Mauna Kea is about a million years old , and has thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago . In its current post-shield state , its lava is more viscous , resulting in a steeper profile . Late volcanism has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes ; contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones , the decentralization of its rift zones , the glaciation on its peak , and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds . Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now considered dormant . In Hawaiian mythology , the peaks of the island of Hawai \u02bbi are sacred . An ancient law allowed only high - ranking ali\u02bbi to visit its peak . Ancient Hawaiians living on the slopes of Mauna Kea relied on its extensive forests for food , and quarried the dense volcano - glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production . When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century , settlers introduced cattle , sheep and game animals , many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain 's ecological balance . Mauna Kea can be ecologically divided into three sections : an alpine climate at its summit , a Sophora chrysophylla -- Myoporum sandwicense ( or m\u0101mane -- naio ) forest on its flanks , and an Acacia koa -- Metrosideros polymorpha ( or koa -- \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba ) forest , now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry , at its base . In recent years , concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain . With its high elevation , dry environment , and stable airflow , Mauna Kea 's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation . Since the creation of an access road in 1964 , thirteen telescopes funded by eleven countries have been constructed at the summit . The Mauna Kea Observatories are used for scientific research across the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light to radio , and comprise the largest such facility in the world . Their construction on a landscape considered sacred by Native Hawaiians continues to be a topic of debate .

Mauna Kea is one of five hotspot volcanoes that form the island of Hawaii , the largest and youngest island of the Hawaiian -- Emperor seamount chain . Of these five volcanoes , Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active . It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago , and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago . Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000 years ago , and is currently dormant . Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera , but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit . A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits . Mauna Kea is over 3,200 km ( 770 cu mi ) in volume , so massive that it and its neighbor , Mauna Loa , depress the ocean crust beneath it by 6 km ( 4 mi ) . The volcano continues to slip and flatten under its own weight at a rate of less than 0.2 mm ( 0.01 in ) per year . Much of its mass lies east of its present summit . Mauna Kea stands 4,205 m ( 13,800 ft ) above sea level , just 35 m ( 110 ft ) higher than its neighbor Mauna Loa , and is the highest point in the state of Hawaii . Measured from its base on the ocean floor , it rises over 10,000 m ( 33,000 ft ) , significantly greater than the elevation of Mount Everest above sea level . Like all Hawaiian volcanoes , Mauna Kea has been created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth 's underlying mantle . The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that , over 70 million years , has created the 6,000 km ( 3,700 mi ) - long Hawaiian Ridge -- Emperor seamount chain . The prevailing , though not completely settled , view is that the hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet 's mantle for much , if not all of the Cenozoic Era . However , while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied , there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect . Lava flows from Mauna Kea overlapped in complex layers with those of its neighbors during its growth . Most prominently , Mauna Kea is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest , and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south . The original eruptive fissures ( rift zones ) in the flanks of Mauna Kea were buried by its post-shield volcanism . Hilo Ridge , a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of Mauna Kea , was once believed to be a part of the volcano ; however , it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger Mauna Kea flows . The shield - stage lavas that built the enormous main mass of the mountain are tholeiitic basalts , like those of Mauna Loa , created through the mixing of primary magma and subducted oceanic crust . They are covered by the oldest exposed rock strata on Mauna Kea , the post-shield alkali basalts of the H\u0101m\u0101kua Volcanics , which erupted between 250,000 and 70 -- 65,000 years ago . The most recent volcanic flows are hawaiites and mugearites : they are the post-shield Laup\u0101hoehoe Volcanics , erupted between 65,000 and 4,000 years ago . These changes in lava composition accompanied the slow reduction of the supply of magma to the summit , which led to weaker eruptions that then gave way to isolated episodes associated with volcanic dormancy . The Laup\u0101hoehoe lavas are more viscous and contain more volatiles than the earlier tholeiitic basalts ; their thicker flows significantly steepened Mauna Kea 's flanks . In addition , explosive eruptions have built cinder cones near the summit . These cones are the most recent eruptive centers of Mauna Kea . Its present summit is dominated by lava domes and cinder cones up to 1.5 km ( 0.9 mi ) in diameter and hundreds of meters tall . Scoria and cinder cones on Mauna Kea 's summit in winter Glacial evidence on Mauna Kea , outlining terminal moraines ( `` m '' ) and till ( `` w '' ) Mauna Kea is the only Hawaiian volcano with distinct evidence of glaciation . Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa , but have been covered by later lava flows . Despite Hawaii 's tropical location , during several past ice ages a drop of only a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the mountain 's summit through summer , triggering the formation of an ice cap . There are three episodes of glaciation that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years : the P\u014dhakuloa ( 180 -- 130 ka ) , W\u0101ihu ( 80 -- 60 ka ) and M\u0101kanaka ( 40 -- 13 ka ) series . These have extensively sculpted the summit , depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the mountain 's upper flanks . Subglacial eruptions built cinder cones during the M\u0101kanaka glaciation , most of which were heavily gouged by glacial action . The most recent cones were built between 9000 and 4500 years ago , atop the glacial deposits , although one study indicates that the last eruption may have been around 3600 years ago . At their maximum extent , the glaciers extended from the summit down to between 3,200 and 3,800 m ( 10,500 and 12,500 ft ) of elevation . A small body of permafrost , less than 25 m ( 80 ft ) across , was found at the summit of Mauna Kea prior to 1974 , and may still be present . Small gullies etch the summit , formed by rain - and snow - fed streams that flow only during winter melt and rain showers . On the windward side of the mountain , stream erosion driven by trade winds has accelerated erosion in a manner similar to that on older Kohala . Mauna Kea is home to Lake Waiau , the highest lake in the Pacific Basin . At an altitude of 3,969 m ( 13,022 ft ) , it lies within the Pu \u02bbu Waiau cinder cone and is the only alpine lake in Hawaii . The lake is very small and shallow , with a surface area of 0.73 ha ( 1.80 acres ) and a depth of 3 m ( 10 ft ) . Radiocarbon dating of samples at the base of the lake indicates that it was clear of ice 12,600 years ago . Hawaiian lava types are typically permeable , preventing the formation of lakes due to infiltration . Here , either sulfur - bearing steam altered the volcanic ash to low - permeability clays , or explosive interactions between rising magma and groundwater or surface water ( phreatic eruptions ) formed exceptionally fine ash that also would reduce the permeability of the lake bed . Until 1993 , artesian water was not known to be present in the Island of Hawaii . Drilling by the University of Hawaii at that time encountered an artesian groundwater aquifer at 300 meters below sea level and 100 meters of hole depth within a compacted layer of soil and lava where the flows of both Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea meet ( Humuula saddle region ) . Isotopic composition shows the water present to have been derived from rain coming off Mauna Kea at an elevation higher than 2000 meters above mean sea level . Its presence is attributed to a freshwater head within Mauna Kea 's basal lens . Scientists believe there may be more water in Mauna Kea 's fresh water lens than current models may indicate . In 2012 two more bore holes were drilled on Mauna Kea and water discovered at much higher elevations than previously believed but shallower than expected . Donald Thomas , director of the University of Hawaii 's Center for the Study of Active Volcanoes believes one reason to continue study of the aquifers is due to use and ' occupancy ' of the higher elevation areas , stating : `` Nearly all of these activities depend on the availability of potable water that , in most cases , must be trucked to the Saddle from Waimea or Hilo -- an inefficient and expensive process that consumes a substantial quantity of our scarce liquid fuels . '' Future activity ( edit ) The last eruption of Mauna Kea was about 4,600 years ago ( about 2600 BCE ) ; because of this inactivity , Mauna Kea is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks , out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 ( which is given to the extinct volcano Kohala ) . Twenty percent of the volcano 's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000 years , and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time . Despite its dormancy , Mauna Kea is expected to erupt again , although there would be sufficient warning to evacuate . The telescopes on Mauna Kea 's summit would be the first to detect the minute amounts of deformation resulting from the volcano 's swelling , acting like expensive tiltmeters . Based on prior eruptions , such an event could occur anywhere on the volcano 's upper flanks and would likely produce extended lava flows , mostly of a'a , of 15 -- 25 km ( 9 -- 16 mi ) in length . Long periods of activity could build a cinder cone at the source . Although not likely in the next few centuries , such an eruption would probably result in little loss of life but significant damage to infrastructure . Geologically recent Mauna Kea cinder cones and lava flows Hazard mapping of Mauna Kea and nearby Kohala Human History ( edit ) Native History ( edit ) A stone structure or ahu facing Mauna Kea , on Saddle Road between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa . The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores , where food and water were plentiful . Settlement expanded inland to the Mauna Loa -- Mauna Kea region in the 12th and early 13th centuries . Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting , collecting stone material , and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations . The mountain 's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter . Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source . Early settlement of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions , particularly amongst bird species . Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals , and their arrival was associated with increased rates of erosion . The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland ; some of this change was caused by the use of fire , but the prevailing cause of forest ecosystem collapse and avian extinction on Hawaii appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian ( or Pacific ) rat . The summits of the five volcanoes of Hawaii are revered as sacred mountains ; and Mauna Kea 's summit , the highest , is the most sacred . For this reason , a kapu ( ancient Hawaiian law ) restricted visitor rights to high - ranking ali\u02bbi . Hawaiians associated elements of their natural environment with particular deities . In Hawaiian mythology , the summit of Mauna Kea was seen as the `` region of the gods '' , a place where benevolent spirits reside . Poli \u02bbahu , deity of snow , also resides there . In Hawaiian , Mauna Kea is a shortened form of Mauna a Wakea which denotes the mountain 's connection to the sky father Wakea ; however , the English translation of Mauna Kea is `` white mountain '' in reference to its seasonally snow - capped summit . Around AD 1100 , natives established adze quarries high up on Mauna Kea to extract the uniquely dense basalt ( generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions ) to make tools . Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear , and m\u0101mane wood was preferred for the handles . At peak quarry activity after AD 1400 , there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting ; shelters with food , water , and wood to sustain the workers ; and workshops creating the finished product . Lake Waiau provided drinking water for the workers . Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water , to give them the strength of the mountain . Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans . As part of the ritual associated with quarrying , the workers erected shrines to their gods ; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites , most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve . This early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century . Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long - term welfare of the environment . These ahupua \u02bba generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast . Mauna Kea 's summit was encompassed in the ahupua \u02bba of Ka \u02bbohe , with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humu \u02bbula . Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the m\u0101mane -- naio forest of its upper slopes , which provided them with vegetation and bird life . Bird species hunted included the \u02bbua\u02bbu ( Pterodroma sandwichensis ) , n\u0113n\u0113 ( Branta sandvicensis ) , and palila ( Loxioides bailleui ) . The lower koa -- \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration . Modern era ( edit ) View of the mountain from Mauna Loa Observatory There are three accounts of foreigners visiting Hawaii before the arrival of James Cook , in 1778 . However , the earliest Western depictions of the isle , including Mauna Kea , were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries . Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents . Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases ; port cities including Hilo , Kealakekua , and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade ; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools . In 1793 , cattle were brought by George Vancouver as a tribute to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century , they had escaped confinement and roamed the island freely , greatly damaging its ecosystem . In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended Kamehameha I , who put him in charge of cattle management on the island . With an additional land grant in 1845 , Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea , a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today . Settlers to the island burned and cut down much of the native forest for the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses . The Saddle Road , named for its crossing of the saddle - shaped plateau between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa , was completed in 1943 , and eased travel to Mauna Kea considerably . The Pohakuloa Training Area on the plateau is the largest military training ground in Hawaii . The 108,863 - acre ( 44,055 ha ) base extends from the volcano 's lower flanks to 2,070 m ( 6,790 ft ) elevation , on state land leased to the US Army since 1956 . There are 15 threatened and endangered plants , 3 endangered birds , and 1 endangered bat species in the area . Mauna Kea has been the site of extensive archaeological research since the 1980s . Approximately 27 percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000 , identifying 76 shrines , 4 adze manufacturing workshops , 3 other markers , 1 positively identified burial site , and 4 possible burial sites . By 2009 , the total number of identified sites had risen to 223 , and archaeological research on the volcano 's upper flanks is ongoing . It has been suggested that the shrines , which are arranged around the volcano 's summit along what may be an ancient snow line , are markers for the transition to the sacred part of Mauna Kea . Despite many references to burial around Mauna Kea in Hawaiian oral history , few sites have been confirmed . The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial . Ascents ( edit ) David Douglas , a Scottish botanist who died on Mauna Kea in 1834 In pre-contact times , natives traveling up Mauna Kea were probably guided more by landscape than by existing trails , as no evidence of the latter has been found . It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead . Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea 's slopes to visit family - maintained shrines near its summit , and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day . However , very few natives actually reached the summit , because of the strict kapu placed on it . In the early 19th century , the earliest notable recorded ascents of Mauna Kea included the following : On August 26 , 1823 , Joseph F. Goodrich , an American missionary , made the first recorded ascent in a single day ; however , a small arrangement of stones he observed suggested he was not the first human on the summit . He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit , and also visited Lake Waiau . On June 17 , 1825 , an expedition from HMS Blonde , led by botanist James Macrae , reached the summit of Mauna Kea . Macrae was the first person to record the Mauna Kea silversword ( Argyroxiphium sandwicense ) , saying : `` The last mile was destitute of vegetation except one plant of the Sygenisia tribe , in growth much like a Yucca , with sharp pointed silver coloured leaves and green upright spike of three or four feet producing pendulous branches with brown flowers , truly superb , and almost worth the journey of coming here to see it on purpose . '' In January 1834 , David Douglas climbed the mountain and described extensively the division of plant species by altitude . On a second climb in July , he was found dead in a pit intended to catch wild cattle . Although murder was suspected , it was probably an accidental fall . The site , Ka lua kauka 19 \u00b0 53 \u2032 17 '' N 155 \u00b0 20 \u2032 17 '' W \ufeff \/ \ufeff 19.88806 \u00b0 N 155.33806 \u00b0 W \ufeff \/ 19.88806 ; - 155.33806 \ufeff ( Kaluakauka ) , is marked by the Douglas fir trees named for him . In 1881 , Queen Emma traveled to the peak to bathe in the waters of Lake Waiau during competition for the role of ruling chief of the Kingdom of Hawaii . On August 6 , 1889 , E.D. Baldwin left Hilo and followed cattle trails to the summit . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed , often by the movement of game herds , that could be traveled on horseback . However , vehicular access to the summit was practically impossible until the construction of a road in 1964 , and it continues to be restricted . Today , multiple trails to the summit exist , in various states of use . Ecology ( edit ) Background ( edit ) Hawaii 's geographical isolation strongly influences its ecology . Remote islands like Hawaii have a large number of species that are found nowhere else ( see Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands ) . The remoteness resulted in evolutionary lines distinct from those elsewhere and isolated these endemic species from external biotic influence , and also makes them especially vulnerable to extinction and the effects of invasive species . In addition the ecosystems of Hawaii are under threat from human development including the clearing of land for agriculture ; an estimated third of the island 's endemic species have already been wiped out . Because of its elevation , Mauna Kea has the greatest diversity of biotic ecosystems anywhere in the Hawaiian archipelago . Ecosystems on the mountain form concentric rings along its slopes due to changes in temperature and precipitation with elevation . These ecosystems can be roughly divided into three sections by elevation : alpine -- subalpine , montane , and basal forest . Contact with Americans and Europeans in the early 19th century brought more settlers to the island , and had a lasting negative ecological effect . On lower slopes , vast tracts of koa -- \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba forest were converted to farmland . Higher up , feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in , and damaged extensively , Mauna Kea 's native m\u0101mane -- naio forest . Non-native plants are the other serious threat ; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island , whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000 . Alpine environment ( edit ) Mauna Kea silversword ( Argyroxiphium sandwicense sandwicense ) growing near the volcano 's summit . The summit of Mauna Kea lies above the tree line , and consists of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra . An area of heavy snowfall , it is inhospitable to vegetation , and is known as the Hawaiian tropical high shrublands . Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures , a short growing season , low rainfall , and snow during winter months . A lack of soil also retards root growth , makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground , and gives the area a very low water retention capacity . Plant species found at this elevation include Styphelia tameiameiae , Taraxacum officinale , Tetramolopium humile , Agrostis sandwicensis , Anthoxanthum odoratum , Trisetum glomeratum , Poa annua , Sonchus oleraceus , and Coprosma ernodiodes . One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword ( Argyroxiphium sandwicense var . sandwicense ) , a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea 's high elevation cinder deserts . At one stage reduced to a population of just 50 plants , Mauna Kea silversword was thought to be restricted to the alpine zone , but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock , and can grow at lower elevations as well . The Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve on the southern summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981 . The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock , including areas of aeolian desert and Lake Waiau . This ecosystem is a likely haven for the threatened \u02bbua\u02bbu ( Pterodroma sandwichensis ) and also the center of a study on w\u0113kiu bugs ( Nysius wekiuicola ) . W\u0113kiu bugs feed on dead insect carcasses that drift up Mauna Kea on the wind and settle on snow banks . This is a highly unusual food source for a species in the genus Nysius , which consists of predominantly seed - eating insects . They can survive at extreme elevations of up to 4,200 m ( 13,780 ft ) because of natural antifreeze in their blood . They also stay under heated surfaces most of the time . Their conservation status is unclear , but the species is no longer a candidate for the Endangered Species List ; studies on the welfare of the species began in 1980 . The closely related Nysius aa lives on Mauna Loa . Wolf spiders ( Lycosidae ) and forest tent caterpillar moths have also been observed in the same Mauna Kea ecosystem ; the former survive by hiding under heat - absorbing rocks , and the latter through cold - resistant chemicals in their bodies . M\u0101mane -- naio forest ( edit ) A pair of m\u0101mane ( Sophora chrysophylla ) trees The highest forested zone on the volcano , at an elevation of 2,000 -- 3,000 m ( 6,600 -- 9,800 ft ) , is dominated by m\u0101mane ( Sophora chrysophylla ) and naio ( Myoporum sandwicense ) , both endemic tree species , and is thus known as m\u0101mane -- naio forest . M\u0101mane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone , especially the palila ( Loxioides bailleui ) . The palila was formerly found on the slopes of Mauna Kea , Mauna Loa , and Hual\u0101lai , but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea -- only 10 % of its former range -- and has been declared critically endangered . The largest threat to the ecosystem is grazing by feral sheep ( Ovis aries ) , cattle ( Bos primigenius ) , and goats ( Capra hircus ) introduced to the island in the late 18th century . Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed as far back as the late 1920s , and continued through to 1949 . One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and woody plants , both endemic and introduced , that were resistant to browsing . The feral animals were almost eradicated , and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s . However , an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals , and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources , the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management , changed its policy to a sustained - control program designed to facilitate the sport . Mouflon ( Ovis aries orientalis ) was introduced from 1962 -- 1964 , and a plan to release axis deer ( Axis axis ) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry , who said that they would damage crops and spread disease . The hunting industry fought back , and the back - and - forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern . With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing , conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea 's ecosystem . A plan was proposed to fence 25 % of the forests for protection , and manage the remaining 75 % for game hunting . Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action . While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence . In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed ; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources , claiming that they were violating federal law , in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources ( 1978 ) . The court ruled in favor of conservationists and upheld the precedence of federal laws before state control of wildlife . Having violated the Endangered Species Act , Hawaii state was required to remove all feral animals from the mountainside . This decision was followed by a second court order in 1981 . A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals , at least temporarily . An active control program is in place , though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the m\u0101mane - naio ecosystem . There are many other species and ecosystems on the island , and on Mauna Kea , that remain threatened by human development and invasive species . The Mauna Kea Forest Reserve protects 52,500 acres ( 212 km ) of m\u0101mane - naio forest under the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources . Ungulate hunting is allowed year - round . A small part of the m\u0101mane -- naio forest is encompassed by the Mauna Kea State Recreation Area . Lower environment ( edit ) The \u02bbalal\u0101 or Hawaiian crow ( Corvus hawaiiensis ) is a bird in the crow family . It is extinct in the wild , with plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge . A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea 's lower slopes was formerly Acacia koa -- Metrosideros polymorpha ( koa - \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba ) forest . Its destruction was driven by an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century , as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes . Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations . Most of the houses on the island were built of koa , and those parts of the forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes . The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880 , and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui . With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s , much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing , small - scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp . The Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge is a major koa forest reserve on Mauna Kea 's windward slope . It was established in 1985 , covering 32,733 acres ( 13,247 ha ) of ecosystem remnant . Eight endangered bird species , twelve endangered plants , and the endangered Hawaiian hoary bat ( Lasiurus cinereus semotus ) have been observed in the area , in addition to many other rare biota . The reserve has been the site of an extensive replanting campaign since 1989 . Parts of the reserve show the effect of agriculture on the native ecosystem , as much of the land in the upper part of the reserve is abandoned farmland . Bird species native to the acacia koa -- \u02bb\u014dhi\u02bba forest include the Hawaiian crow ( Corvus hawaiiensis ) , the \u02bbakepa ( Loxops coccineus ) , Hawaii creeper ( Oreomystis mana ) , \u02bbakiap\u014dl\u0101\u02bbau ( Hemignathus munroi ) , and Hawaiian hawk ( Buteo solitarius ) , all of which are endangered , threatened , or near threatened ; the Hawaiian crow in particular is extinct in the wild , but there are plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve . Summit Observatories ( edit ) Main articles : Mauna Kea Observatories and Opposition to the Mauna Kea Observatories Sunset over four telescopes of the Mauna Kea Observatories . From left to right : the Subaru Telescope , the twin Keck I and II telescopes , and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility Mauna Kea 's summit is one of the best sites in the world for astronomical observation due to favorable observing conditions . The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum . The summit is above the inversion layer , keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry , and free of atmospheric pollution . The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable , lacking turbulence for some of the world 's best astronomical seeing . The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea 's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area ; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects . These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing . In the early 1960s , the Hawaii Island Chamber of Commerce encouraged astronomical development of Mauna Kea , as economic stimulus ; this coincided with University of Arizona astronomer Gerard Kuiper 's search for sites to use newly improved detectors of infrared light . Site testing by Kuiper 's assistant Alika Herring in 1964 confirmed the summit 's outstanding suitability . An intense three - way competition for NASA funds to construct a large telescope began between Kuiper , Harvard University , and the University of Hawaii ( UH ) , which only had experience in solar astronomy . This culminated in funds being awarded to the `` upstart '' UH proposal . UH rebuilt its small astronomy department into a new Institute for Astronomy , and in 1968 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources gave it a 65 - year lease for all land within a 4 km ( 2.5 mi ) radius of its telescope , essentially that above 11,500 ft ( 3,505 m ) . On its completion in 1970 , the UH 88 in ( 2.2 m ) was the seventh largest optical \/ infrared telescope in the world . Mauna Kea from the summit of Haleakal\u0101 on Maui , approximately 78 mi ( 126 km ) away By 1970 , two 24 in ( 0.6 m ) telescopes had been constructed by the US Air Force and Lowell Observatory . In 1973 , Canada and France agreed to build the 3.6 m CFHT on Mauna Kea . However , local organisations started to raise concerns about the environmental impact of the observatory . This led the Department of Land and Natural Resources to prepare an initial management plan , drafted in 1977 and supplemented in 1980 . In January 1982 , the UH Board of Regents approved a plan to support the continued development of scientific facilities at the site . In 1998 , 2,033 acres ( 823 ha ) were transferred from the observatory lease to supplement the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve . The 1982 plan was replaced in 2000 by an extension designed to serve until 2020 : it instituted an Office of Mauna Kea Management , designated 525 acres ( 212 ha ) for astronomy , and shifted the remaining 10,763 acres ( 4,356 ha ) to `` natural and cultural preservation '' . This plan was further revised to address concern expressed in the Hawaiian community that a lack of respect was being shown toward the cultural values of the mountain . Today the Mauna Kea Science Reserve has 13 observation facilities , each funded by as many as 11 countries . There are nine telescopes working in the visible and infrared spectrum , three in the submillimeter spectrum , and one in the radio spectrum , with mirrors or dishes ranging from 0.9 to 25 m ( 3 to 82 ft ) . In comparison , the Hubble Space Telescope has a 2.4 m ( 7.9 ft ) mirror , similar in size to the UH88 , now the second smallest telescope on the mountain . A `` Save Mauna Kea '' movement , believes development of the mountain to be sacrilegious . Native Hawaiian non-profit groups such as Kahea , concerned with cultural heritage and the environment also oppose development for cultural and religious reasons . The multi-telescope `` outrigger '' , proposed in 2006 was eventually canceled . A planned new telescope , the Thirty Meter Telescope ( TMT ) , has attracted controversy and protests . The TMT was approved in April 2013 . In October 2014 , the groundbreaking ceremony for the telescope was interrupted by protesters causing the project to temporarily halt . In late March 2015 , demonstrators blocked access of the road to the summit again . On April 2 , 2015 , 300 protestors were gathered near the visitor 's center when 12 people were arrested with 11 more arrested at the summit . Among the concerns of the protest groups are the land appraisals and Native Hawaiians consultation . Construction was halted on April 7 , 2015 after protests expanded over the state . After several halts , the project has been voluntarily postponed . Governor Ige announced substantial changes to the management of Mauna Kea in the future but stated the project can move forward . A pending court case has been accepted by the Supreme Court of Hawaii over the project by a number of groups . Climate ( edit ) The summit of Mauna Kea has an alpine climate . Due to the influence of its tropical latitude , temperature swings are very low in spite of its high elevation . Frosts are common year round , but in spite of the elevation no month is nearly below freezing in terms of average high , although March almost falls below 32 \u00b0 F ( 0 \u00b0 C ) in average means .

The area includes several recreation parks including Kalopa State Recreation Area , Wailuku River State Park and Akaka Falls State Park . There are over 3,000 registered hunters on Hawaii island , and hunting , for both recreation and sustenance , is a common activity on Mauna Kea . A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs , sheep , goats , turkey , pheasants , and quail . The Mauna Kea State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport . Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain . A popular site is K\u012bpuka Pu'u Huluhulu , a k\u012bpuka on Mauna Kea 's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill . Mauna Kea 's great elevation and the steepness of its flanks provide a better view and a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa . The high elevation with its risk of altitude sickness , weather concerns , steep road grade , and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult . Until the construction of roads in the mid-20th century , only the hardy visited Mauna Kea 's upper slopes ; hunters tracked game animals , and hikers traveled up the mountain . These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps , and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived . The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964 , making the peak itself accessible to larger numbers of people . Today , multiple hiking trails exist , including the Mauna Kea Trail , and by 2007 over 100,000 tourists and 32,000 vehicles were going each year to the Visitor Information Station ( VIS ) adjacent to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy . The Mauna Kea Access Road is paved up to the Center at 2,804 m ( 9,199 ft ) . One study reported that around a third of visitors and two thirds of professional astronomers working on the mountain have experienced symptoms of acute altitude sickness ; visitors traveling up the volcano 's flanks are advised to stop for at least half an hour and preferably longer at the visitor center to acclimate to the higher elevation . It is strongly recommended to use a four - wheel drive vehicle to drive all the way to the top . Brakes often overheat on the way down and there is no fuel available on Mauna Kea . A free Star Gazing Program is held at the VIS every night from 6 - 10 pm . Between 5,000 and 6,000 people visit the summit of Mauna Kea each year , and to help ensure safety , and protect the integrity of the mountain , a ranger program was implemented in 2001 .

Owner Amazon Key people Andy Jassy ( CEO ) Industry Web service , cloud computing Revenue $17.4 billion ( 2017 ) Operating income $1.3 billion Subsidiaries Annapurna Labs AWS Elemental Website aws.amazon.com Launched March 2006 ; 12 years ago ( 2006 - 03 ) Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on - demand cloud computing platforms to individuals , companies and governments , on a paid subscription basis . The technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers , available all the time , through the Internet . AWS 's version of virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware ( CPU ( s ) & GPU ( s ) for processing , local \/ RAM memory , hard - disk \/ SSD storage ) ; a choice of operating systems ; networking ; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers , databases , CRM , etc . Each AWS system also virtualizes its console I \/ O ( keyboard , display , and mouse ) , allowing AWS subscribers to connect to their AWS system using a modern browser . The browser acts as a window into the virtual computer , letting subscribers log - in , configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer . They can choose to deploy their AWS systems to provide internet - based services for themselves and their customers . The AWS technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world , and maintained by the Amazon subsidiary . Fees are based on a combination of usage , the hardware \/ OS \/ software \/ networking features chosen by the subscriber , required availability , redundancy , security , and service options . Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer , a dedicated physical computer , or clusters of either . As part of the subscription agreement , Amazon provides security for subscribers ' system . AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America . In 2017 , AWS comprised more than 90 services spanning a wide range including computing , storage , networking , database , analytics , application services , deployment , management , mobile , developer tools , and tools for the Internet of Things . The most popular include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) and Amazon Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) . Most services are not exposed directly to end users , but instead offer functionality through APIs for developers to use in their applications . Amazon Web Services ' offerings are accessed over HTTP , using the REST architectural style and SOAP protocol . Amazon markets AWS to subscribers as a way of obtaining large scale computing capacity more quickly and cheaply than building an actual physical server farm . All services are billed based on usage , but each service measures usage in varying ways . As of 2017 , AWS owns a dominant 34 % of all cloud ( IaaS , PaaS ) while the next three competitors Microsoft , Google , and IBM have 11 % , 8 % , 6 % respectively according to Synergy Group .

The AWS platform was launched in July 2002 , in the beginning , the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services . Then in late 2003 , the AWS concept was publicly reformulated when Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper describing a vision for Amazon 's retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized , completely automated , and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway . Near the end of their paper , they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service , proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment . In November 2004 , the first AWS service launched for public usage : Simple Queue Service ( SQS ) . Thereafter Pinkham and lead developer Christopher Brown developed the Amazon EC2 service , with a team in Cape Town , South Africa . Amazon Web Services was officially re-launched on March 14 , 2006 , combining the three initial service offerings of Amazon S3 cloud storage , SQS , and EC2 . The AWS platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services , as Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black had proposed back in 2003 , as a service offered to other developers , web sites , client - side applications , and companies . Andy Jassy , AWS founder and vice president in 2006 , said at the time that Amazon S3 ( one of the first and most scalable elements of AWS ) `` helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data , whether it will be safe and secure , if it will be available when they need it , the costs associated with server maintenance , or whether they have enough storage available . Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data , rather than figuring out how to store it . '' . In 2016 Jassy was promoted to CEO of the division . Reflecting the success of AWS , his annual compensation in 2017 hit nearly $36 million . To support industry - wide training and skills standardization , AWS began offering a certification program for computer engineers , on April 30 , 2013 , to highlight expertise in cloud computing . James Hamilton , an AWS engineer , wrote a retrospective article in 2016 to highlight the ten - year history of the online service from 2006 to 2016 . As an early fan and outspoken proponent of the technology , he had joined the AWS engineering team in 2008 . In 2016 AWS partnered with Digital Currency Group to create a laboratory environment allowing companies to experiment with blockchain technologies . In January 2018 , Amazon launched an autoscaling service on AWS . Growth and profitability In November 2010 , it was reported that all of Amazon. com 's retail sites had been completely moved under the AWS umbrella . Prior to 2012 , AWS was considered a part of Amazon.com and so its revenue was not delineated in Amazon financial statements . In that year industry watchers for the first time estimated AWS revenue to be over $1.5 billion . In April 2015 , Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable , with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year and $265 million of operating income . Founder Jeff Bezos described it as a fast - growing $5 billion business ; analysts described it as `` surprisingly more profitable than forecast '' . In October 2015 , Amazon.com said in its Q3 earnings report that AWS 's operating income was $521 million , with operating margins at 25 percent . AWS 's 2015 Q3 revenue was $2.1 billion , a 78 % increase from 2014 's Q3 revenue of $1.17 billion . 2015 Q4 revenue for the AWS segment increased 69.5 % y \/ y to $2.4 billion with 28.5 % operating margin , giving AWS a $9.6 billion run rate . In 2015 , Gartner estimated that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers . In 2016 Q1 , revenue was $2.57 billion with net income of $604 million , a 64 % increase over 2015 Q1 that resulted in AWS being more profitable than Amazon 's North American retail business for the first time . In the first quarter of 2016 , Amazon experienced a 42 % rise in stock value as a result of increased earnings , of which AWS contributed 56 % to corporate profits . AWS had $17.46 billion in annual revenue in 2017 . Customer base On March 14 , 2006 , Amazon said in a press release : `` More than 150,000 developers have signed up to use Amazon Web Services since its inception . '' In November 2012 , AWS hosted its first customer event in Las Vegas . On May 13 , 2013 , AWS was awarded an Agency Authority to Operate ( ATO ) from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program . In October 2013 , it was revealed that AWS was awarded a $600 M contract with the CIA . During August 2014 , AWS received Department of Defense - Wide provisional authorization for all U.S. Regions . During the 2015 re : Invent keynote , AWS disclosed that they have more than a million active customers every month in 190 countries , including nearly 2,000 government agencies , 5,000 education institutions and more than 17,500 nonprofits . On April 5 , 2017 , AWS and DXC Technology ( formed from a merger of CSC and HPE ) announced an expanded alliance to increase access of AWS features for enterprise clients in existing data centers . Notable customers include NASA , the Obama presidential campaign of 2012 , Kempinski Hotels , and Netflix . Significant service outages On April 20 , 2011 , AWS suffered a major outage . Parts of the Elastic Block Store ( EBS ) service became `` stuck '' and could not fulfill read \/ write requests . It took at least two days for service to be fully restored . On June 29 , 2012 , several websites that rely on Amazon Web Services were taken offline due to a severe storm in Northern Virginia , where AWS ' largest data center cluster is located . On October 22 , 2012 , a major outage occurred , affecting many sites such as Reddit , Foursquare , Pinterest , and others . The cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent . On December 24 , 2012 , AWS suffered another outage causing websites such as Netflix to be unavailable for customers in the Northeastern United States . AWS cited their Elastic Load Balancing ( ELB ) service as the cause . On February 28 , 2017 , AWS experienced a massive outage of S3 services in its Northern Virginia region . A majority of websites which relied on AWS S3 either hung or stalled , and Amazon reported within five hours that AWS was fully online again . No data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage . The outage was caused by a human error made while debugging , that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended , which caused a domino effect of outages . Availability and topology Map showing Amazon Web Services ' availability zones within geographic regions around the world . Amazon Web Services in Kenya ( 2017 ) . As of 2017 , AWS has distinct operations in 16 geographical `` regions '' : 6 in North America , 1 in South America , 4 in EMEA , and 6 in Asia Pacific . AWS has announced 6 new regions that will be coming online in China , Bahrain , France , Hong Kong , Sweden , and in the US - East region for government usage . Each region is wholly contained within a single country and all of its data and services stay within the designated region . Each region has multiple `` Availability Zones '' , which consist of one or more discrete data centers , each with redundant power , networking and connectivity , housed in separate facilities . Availability Zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region , since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between Zones . Several services can operate across Availability Zones ( e.g. , S3 , DynamoDB ) while others can be configured to replicate across Zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures . As of December 2014 , Amazon Web Services operated an estimated 1.4 million servers across 28 availability zones . The global network of AWS Edge locations consists of 54 points of presence worldwide , including locations in the United States , Europe , Asia , Australia , and South America . In 2014 , AWS claimed its aim was to achieve 100 % renewable energy usage in the future . In the United States , AWS 's partnerships with renewable energy providers include Community Energy of Virginia , to support the US East region ; Pattern Development , in January 2015 , to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge ; Iberdrola Renewables , LLC , in July 2015 , to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US East ; EDP Renewables North America , in November 2015 , to construct and operate Amazon Wind Farm US Central ; and Tesla Motors , to apply battery storage technology to address power needs in the US West ( Northern California ) region . Pop - up lofts AWS also has `` pop - up lofts '' in different locations around the world . These market AWS to entrepreneurs and startups in different tech industries in a physical location . Visitors can work or relax inside the loft , or learn more about what they can do with AWS . In June 2014 , AWS opened their first temporary pop - up loft in San Francisco . In May 2015 they expanded to New York City , and in September 2015 expanded to Berlin . AWS opened their fourth location , in Tel Aviv from March 1 , 2016 to March 22 , 2016 . A pop - up loft was open in London from September 10 to October 29 , 2015 . Charitable work In 2017 AWS launched a program in the United Kingdom to help young adults and military veterans retrain in technology - related skills . In partnership with the Prince 's Trust and the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) , AWS will help to provide re-training opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and former soldiers . AWS is working alongside a number of partner companies including Cloudreach , Sage , EDF Energy and Tesco Bank .

MacCarthy et al . Easiest route glacier \/ snow \/ ice climb Mount Logan \/ \u02c8lo\u028a\u0261\u0259n \/ is the highest mountain in Canada and the second - highest peak in North America , after Denali . The mountain was named after Sir William Edmond Logan , a Canadian geologist and founder of the Geological Survey of Canada ( GSC ) . Mount Logan is located within Kluane National Park Reserve in southwestern Yukon , less than 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) north of the Yukon \/ Alaska border . Mount Logan is the source of the Hubbard and Logan Glaciers . Logan is believed to have the largest base circumference of any non-volcanic mountain on Earth ( a large number of shield volcanoes are much larger in size and mass ) , including a massif with eleven peaks over 5,000 metres ( 16,400 ft ) . Due to active tectonic uplifting , Mount Logan is still rising in height . Before 1992 , the exact elevation of Mount Logan was unknown and measurements ranged from 5,959 to 6,050 metres ( 19,551 to 19,849 ft ) . In May 1992 , a GSC expedition climbed Mount Logan and fixed the current height of 5,959 metres ( 19,551 ft ) using GPS . Temperatures are extremely low on and near Mount Logan . On the 5,000 m high plateau , air temperature hovers around \u2212 45 \u00b0 C ( \u2212 49 \u00b0 F ) in the winter and reaches near freezing in summer with the median temperature for the year around \u2212 27 \u00b0 C ( \u2212 17 \u00b0 F ) . Minimal snow melt leads to a significant ice cap , reaching almost 300 m ( 984 ft ) in certain spots .

An international team of Canadian , British and American climbers was assembled and initially they had planned their attempt in 1924 but funding and preparation delays postponed the trip until 1925 .

It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat . Beta cells are sensitive to glucose concentrations , also known as blood sugar levels . When the glucose level is high , the beta cells secrete insulin into the blood ; when glucose levels are low , secretion of insulin is inhibited . Their neighboring alpha cells , by taking their cues from the beta cells , secrete glucagon into the blood in the opposite manner : increased secretion when blood glucose is low , and decreased secretion when glucose concentrations are high . Glucagon , through stimulating the liver to release glucose by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis , has the opposite effect of insulin . The secretion of insulin and glucagon into the blood in response to the blood glucose concentration is the primary mechanism of glucose homeostasis . If beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction , insulin can no longer be synthesized or be secreted into the blood . This results in type 1 diabetes mellitus , which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations , and generalized body wasting . In type 2 diabetes mellitus the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes , and is not due to an autoimmune process . Instead there is an accumulation of amyloid in the pancreatic islets , which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology . The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta - cells , reduced secretory function of islet beta - cells that survive , and peripheral tissue insulin resistance . Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by , and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood . Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose . As a result , the insulin levels , even when the blood sugar level is normal , are much higher than they are in healthy persons . There are a variety of treatment regimens , none of which is entirely satisfactory . When the pancreas 's capacity to secrete insulin can no longer keep the blood sugar level within normal bounds , insulin injections are given . The human insulin protein is composed of 51 amino acids , and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da . It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B - chain , which are linked together by disulfide bonds . Insulin 's structure varies slightly between species of animals . Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness ( in carbohydrate metabolism effects ) from human insulin because of these variations . Porcine insulin is especially close to the human version , and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by recombinant DNA technologies . The crystal structure of insulin in the solid state was determined by Dorothy Hodgkin . It is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines , the most important medications needed in a basic health system .

The molecular origins of insulin go at least as far back as the simplest unicellular eukaryotes . Apart from animals , insulin - like proteins are also known to exist in the Fungi and Protista kingdoms . Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreatic islets in most vertebrates and by the Brockmann body in some teleost fish . Cone snails Conus geographus and Conus tulipa , venomous sea snails that hunt small fish , use modified forms of insulin in their venom cocktails . The insulin toxin , closer in structure to fishes ' than to snails ' native insulin , slows down the prey fishes by lowering their blood glucose levels . Gene ( edit ) The preproinsulin precursor of insulin is encoded by the INS gene . Alleles ( edit ) A variety of mutant alleles with changes in the coding region have been identified . A read - through gene , INS - IGF2 , overlaps with this gene at the 5 ' region and with the IGF2 gene at the 3 ' region . Regulation ( edit ) Diagram of insulin regulation upon high blood glucose In the pancreatic \u03b2 cells , glucose is the primary physiological stimulus for the regulation of insulin synthesis . Insulin is mainly regulated through the transcription factors PDX1 , NeuroD1 , and MafA . PDX1 ( Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox protein 1 ) is in the nuclear periphery upon low blood glucose levels interacting with corepressors HDAC1 and 2 which is downregulating the insulin secretion . An increase in blood glucose levels causes phosphorylation of PDX1 and it translocates centrally and binds the A3 element within the insulin promoter . Upon translocation it interacts with coactivators HAT p300 and acetyltransferase set 7 \/ 9 . PDX1 affects the histone modifications through acetylation and deacetylation as well as methylation . It is also said to suppress glucagon . NeuroD1 , also known as \u03b22 , regulates insulin exocytosis in pancreatic \u03b2 cells by directly inducing the expression of genes involved in exocytosis . It is localized in the cytosol , but in response to high glucose it becomes glycosylated by OGT and \/ or phosphorylated by ERK , which causes translocation to the nucleus . In the nucleus \u03b22 heterodimerizes with E47 , binds to the E1 element of the insulin promoter and recruits co-activator p300 which acetylates \u03b22 . It is able to interact with other transcription factors as well in activation of the insulin gene . MafA is degraded by proteasomes upon low blood glucose levels . Increased levels of glucose makes an unknown protein glycosylated . This protein works as a transcription factor for MafA in an unknown manner and MafA is transported out of the cell . MafA is then translocated back into the nucleus where it binds the C1 element of the insulin promoter . These transcription factors work synergistically and in a complex arrangement . Increased blood glucose can after a while destroy the binding capacities of these proteins , and therefore reduce the amount of insulin secreted , causing diabetes . The decreased binding activities can be mediated by glucose induced oxidative stress and antioxidants are said to prevent the decreased insulin secretion in glucotoxic pancreatic \u03b2 cells . Stress signalling molecules and reactive oxygen species inhibits the insulin gene by interfering with the cofactors binding the transcription factors and the transcription factors it self . Several regulatory sequences in the promoter region of the human insulin gene bind to transcription factors . In general , the A-boxes bind to Pdx1 factors , E-boxes bind to NeuroD , C - boxes bind to MafA , and cAMP response elements to CREB . There are also silencers that inhibit transcription .

Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues , and porcine insulin in one . Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans . Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin , and has similar physiological effects . The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history . The C - peptide of proinsulin ( discussed later ) , however , differs much more among species ; it is also a hormone , but a secondary one . SS - linked insulin monomer The primary structure of bovine insulin was first determined by Frederick Sanger in 1951 . After that , this polypeptide was synthesized independently by several groups . The 3 - dimensional structure of insulin was determined by X-ray crystallography in Dorothy Hodgkin 's laboratory in 1969 ( PDB file 1ins ) . Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer ( a unit of six insulin molecules ) , while the active form is the monomer . The hexamer is an inactive form with long - term stability , which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected , yet readily available . The hexamer - monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection . The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer , which is desirable for practical reasons ; however , the monomer is a much faster - reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size . A fast - reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours , which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules . Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar interdigitated beta - sheets . This can cause injection amyloidosis , and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods . Synthesis , physiological effects , and degradation ( edit ) Synthesis ( edit ) Insulin is produced in the pancreas and the Brockmann body ( in some fish ) , and released when any of several stimuli are detected . These stimuli include ingested protein and glucose in the blood produced from digested food . Carbohydrates can be polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves . If the carbohydrates include glucose , then that glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise . In target cells , insulin initiates a signal transduction , which has the effect of increasing glucose uptake and storage . Finally , insulin is degraded , terminating the response . Insulin undergoes extensive posttranslational modification along the production pathway . Production and secretion are largely independent ; prepared insulin is stored awaiting secretion . Both C - peptide and mature insulin are biologically active . Cell components and proteins in this image are not to scale . In mammals , insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the beta cells . One million to three million pancreatic islets form the endocrine part of the pancreas , which is primarily an exocrine gland . The endocrine portion accounts for only 2 % of the total mass of the pancreas . Within the pancreatic islets , beta cells constitute 65 -- 80 % of all the cells . Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains , the A - and B - chains , linked together by disulfide bonds . It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called preproinsulin in beta cells . Preproinsulin contains a 24 - residue signal peptide which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough endoplasmic reticulum ( RER ) . The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER , forming proinsulin . In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed . About 5 -- 10 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum , proinsulin is transported to the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) where immature granules are formed . Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min . Proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin through the action of cellular endopeptidases known as prohormone convertases ( PC1 and PC2 ) , as well as the exoprotease carboxypeptidase E. The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions , releasing a fragment called the C - peptide , and leaving 2 peptide chains , the B - and A - chains , linked by 2 disulfide bonds . The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues ( lysine - 64 and arginine - 65 , and arginine - 31 and \u2212 32 ) . After cleavage of the C - peptide , these 2 pairs of basic residues are removed by the carboxypeptidase . The C - peptide is the central portion of proinsulin , and the primary sequence of proinsulin goes in the order `` B-C-A '' ( the B and A chains were identified on the basis of mass and the C - peptide was discovered later ) . The resulting mature insulin is packaged inside mature granules waiting for metabolic signals ( such as leucine , arginine , glucose and mannose ) and vagal nerve stimulation to be exocytosed from the cell into the circulation . The endogenous production of insulin is regulated in several steps along the synthesis pathway : At transcription from the insulin gene In mRNA stability At the mRNA translation In the posttranslational modifications Insulin and its related proteins have been shown to be produced inside the brain , and reduced levels of these proteins are linked to Alzheimer 's disease . Release ( edit ) See also : Blood glucose regulation Beta cells in the islets of Langerhans release insulin in two phases . The first - phase release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood glucose levels , and lasts about 10 minutes . The second phase is a sustained , slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar , peaking in 2 to 3 hours . Reduced first - phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of type 2 diabetes . First - phase release and insulin sensitivity are independent predictors of diabetes . The description of first phase release is as follows : Glucose enters the \u03b2 - cells through the glucose transporters , GLUT2 . These glucose transporters have a relatively low affinity for glucose , ensuring that the rate of glucose entry into the \u03b2 - cells is proportional to the extracellular glucose concentration ( within the physiological range ) . At low blood sugar levels very little glucose enters the \u03b2 - cells ; at high blood glucose concentrations large quantities of glucose enter these cells . The glucose that enters the \u03b2 - cell is phosphorylated to glucose - 6 - phosphate ( G - 6 - P ) by glucokinase ( hexokinase IV ) which is not inhibited by G - 6 - P in the way that the hexokinases in other tissues ( hexokinase I -- III ) are affected by this product . This means that the intracellular G - 6 - P concentration remains proportional to the blood sugar concentration . Glucose - 6 - phosphate enters glycolytic pathway and then , via the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction , into the Krebs cycle , where multiple , high - energy ATP molecules are produced by the oxidation of acetyl CoA ( the Krebs cycle substrate ) , leading to a rise in the ATP : ADP ratio within the cell . An increased intracellular ATP : ADP ratio closes the ATP - sensitive SUR1 \/ Kir6. 2 potassium channel ( see sulfonylurea receptor ) . This prevents potassium ions ( K ) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion , leading to a buildup of intracellular potassium ions . As a result , the inside of the cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside , leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane . Upon depolarization , voltage - gated calcium ion ( Ca ) channels open , allowing calcium ions to move into the cell by facilitated diffusion . The cytosolic calcium ion concentration can also be increased by calcium release from intracellular stores via activation of ryanodine receptors . The calcium ion concentration in the cytosol of the beta cells can also , or additionally , be increased through the activation of phospholipase C resulting from the binding of an extracellular ligand ( hormone or neurotransmitter ) to a G protein - coupled membrane receptor . Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid , phosphatidyl inositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , into inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate and diacylglycerol . Inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ( IP3 ) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . This allows the release of Ca ions from the ER via IP3 - gated channels , which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently of the effects of a high blood glucose concentration . Parasympathetic stimulation of the pancreatic islets operates via this pathway to increase insulin secretion into the blood . The significantly increased amount of calcium ions in the cells ' cytoplasm causes the release into the blood of previously synthesized insulin , which has been stored in intracellular secretory vesicles . This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin . Other substances known to stimulate insulin release include the amino acids arginine and leucine , parasympathetic release of acetylcholine ( acting via the phospholipase C pathway ) , sulfonylurea , cholecystokinin ( CCK , also via phospholipase C ) , and the gastrointestinally derived incretins , such as glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) and glucose - dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) . Release of insulin is strongly inhibited by norepinephrine ( noradrenaline ) , which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress . It appears that release of catecholamines by the sympathetic nervous system has conflicting influences on insulin release by beta cells , because insulin release is inhibited by \u03b1 - adrenergic receptors and stimulated by \u03b2 - adrenergic receptors . The net effect of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves and epinephrine from adrenal glands on insulin release is inhibition due to dominance of the \u03b1 - adrenergic receptors . When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value , insulin release from the \u03b2 - cells slows or stops . If the blood glucose level drops lower than this , especially to dangerously low levels , release of hyperglycemic hormones ( most prominently glucagon from islet of Langerhans alpha cells ) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores , supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted . By increasing blood glucose , the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life - threatening hypoglycemia . Evidence of impaired first - phase insulin release can be seen in the glucose tolerance test , demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load ( 75 or 100 g of glucose ) , followed by a slow drop over the next 100 minutes , to remain above 120 mg \/ 100 ml after two hours after the start of the test . In a normal person the blood glucose level is corrected ( and may even be slightly over-corrected ) by the end of the test . Oscillations ( edit ) Main article : Insulin oscillations Insulin release from pancreas oscillates with a period of 3 -- 6 minutes . Even during digestion , in general , one or two hours following a meal , insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous , but oscillates with a period of 3 -- 6 minutes , changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 p mol \/ l to less than 100 pmol \/ l . This is thought to avoid downregulation of insulin receptors in target cells , and to assist the liver in extracting insulin from the blood . This oscillation is important to consider when administering insulin - stimulating medication , since it is the oscillating blood concentration of insulin release , which should , ideally , be achieved , not a constant high concentration . This may be achieved by delivering insulin rhythmically to the portal vein or by islet cell transplantation to the liver . Blood insulin level ( edit ) Further information : Insulin index The idealized diagram shows the fluctuation of blood sugar ( red ) and the sugar - lowering hormone insulin ( blue ) in humans during the course of a day containing three meals . In addition , the effect of a sugar - rich versus a starch - rich meal is highlighted . The blood insulin level can be measured in international units , such as \u03bcIU \/ mL or in molar concentration , such as pmol \/ L , where 1 \u03bcIU \/ mL equals 6.945 pmol \/ L. A typical blood level between meals is 8 -- 11 \u03bcIU \/ mL ( 57 -- 79 pmol \/ L ) . Signal transduction ( edit ) The effects of insulin are initiated by its binding to a receptor present in the cell membrane . The receptor molecule contains an \u03b1 - and \u03b2 subunits . Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer . Insulin binds to the \u03b1 - subunits of the homodimer , which faces the extracellular side of the cells . The \u03b2 subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding . This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the \u03b2 subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates ( IRS ) . The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin . The cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells , and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue , as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver , adipose , and lactating mammary gland tissue , operates via the activation , by IRS - 1 , of phosphoinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) . This enzyme converts a phospholipid in the cell membrane by the name of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) , into phosphatidylinositol 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PIP3 ) , which , in turn , activates protein kinase B ( PKB ) . Activated PKB facilitates the fusion of GLUT4 containing endosomes with the cell membrane , resulting in an increase in GLUT4 transporters in the plasma membrane . PKB also phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK ) , thereby inactivating this enzyme . This means that its substrate , glycogen synthase ( GS ) , can not be phosphorylated , and remains dephosphorylated , and therefore active . The active enzyme , glycogen synthase ( GS ) , catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of glycogen from glucose . Similar dephosphorylations affect the enzymes controlling the rate of glycolysis leading to the synthesis of fats via malonyl - CoA in the tissues that can generate triglycerides , and also the enzymes that control the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver . The overall effect of these final enzyme dephosphorylations is that , in the tissues that can carry out these reactions , glycogen and fat synthesis from glucose are stimulated , and glucose production by the liver through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are inhibited . The breakdown of triglycerides by adipose tissue into free fatty acids and glycerol is also inhibited . After the intracellular signal that resulted from the binding of insulin to its receptor has been produced , termination of signaling is then needed . As mentioned below in the section on degradation , endocytosis and degradation of the receptor bound to insulin is a main mechanism to end signaling . In addition , the signaling pathway is also terminated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the various signaling pathways by tyrosine phosphatases . Serine \/ Threonine kinases are also known to reduce the activity of insulin . The structure of the insulin -- insulin receptor complex has been determined using the techniques of X-ray crystallography . Physiological effects ( edit ) Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism . Insulin binds to its receptor ( 1 ) , which starts many protein activation cascades ( 2 ) . These include translocation of Glut - 4 transporter to the plasma membrane and influx of glucose ( 3 ) , glycogen synthesis ( 4 ) , glycolysis ( 5 ) and triglyceride synthesis ( 6 ) . The insulin signal transduction pathway begins when insulin binds to the insulin receptor proteins . Once the transduction pathway is completed , the GLUT - 4 storage vesicles becomes one with the cellular membrane . As a result , the GLUT - 4 protein channels become embedded into the membrane , allowing glucose to be transported into the cell . The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include : Increase of cellular intake of certain substances , most prominently glucose in muscle and adipose tissue ( about two - thirds of body cells ) Increase of DNA replication and protein synthesis via control of amino acid uptake Modification of the activity of numerous enzymes . The actions of insulin ( indirect and direct ) on cells include : Stimulates the uptake of glucose -- Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration by inducing intake of glucose by the cells . This is possible because Insulin causes the insertion of the GLUT4 transporter in the cell membranes of muscle and fat tissues which allows glucose to enter the cell . Increased fat synthesis -- insulin forces fat cells to take in blood glucose , which is converted into triglycerides ; decrease of insulin causes the reverse . Increased esterification of fatty acids -- forces adipose tissue to make neutral fats ( i.e. , triglycerides ) from fatty acids ; decrease of insulin causes the reverse . Decreased lipolysis -- forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids and glycerol ; decrease of insulin causes the reverse . Induce glycogen synthesis -- When glucose levels are high , insulin induces the formation of glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme , which adds a phosphate group in glucose , thus resulting in a molecule that can not exit the cell . At the same time , insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose - 6 - phosphatase , which removes the phosphate group . These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen . Also , insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis . Decreased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis -- decreases production of glucose from noncarbohydrate substrates , primarily in the liver ( the vast majority of endogenous insulin arriving at the liver never leaves the liver ) ; increase of insulin causes glucose production by the liver from assorted substrates . Decreased proteolysis -- decreasing the breakdown of protein Decreased autophagy -- decreased level of degradation of damaged organelles . Postprandial levels inhibit autophagy completely . Increased amino acid uptake -- forces cells to absorb circulating amino acids ; decrease of insulin inhibits absorption . Arterial muscle tone -- forces arterial wall muscle to relax , increasing blood flow , especially in microarteries ; decrease of insulin reduces flow by allowing these muscles to contract . Increase in the secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells in the stomach . Increased potassium uptake -- forces cells synthesizing glycogen ( a very spongy , `` wet '' substance , that increases the content of intracellular water , and its accompanying K ions ) to absorb potassium from the extracellular fluids ; lack of insulin inhibits absorption . Insulin 's increase in cellular potassium uptake lowers potassium levels in blood plasma . This possibly occurs via insulin - induced translocation of the Na+ \/ K+ - ATPase to the surface of skeletal muscle cells . Decreased renal sodium excretion . Insulin also influences other body functions , such as vascular compliance and cognition . Once insulin enters the human brain , it enhances learning and memory and benefits verbal memory in particular . Enhancing brain insulin signaling by means of intranasal insulin administration also enhances the acute thermoregulatory and glucoregulatory response to food intake , suggesting that central nervous insulin contributes to the co-ordination of a wide variety of homeostatic or regulatory processes in the human body . Insulin also has stimulatory effects on gonadotropin - releasing hormone from the hypothalamus , thus favoring fertility . Degradation ( edit ) Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action , it may be released back into the extracellular environment , or it may be degraded by the cell . The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney . The liver clears most insulin during first - pass transit , whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation . Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin - receptor complex , followed by the action of insulin - degrading enzyme . An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation ( insulin half - life ~ 4 -- 6 minutes ) . Regulator of endocannabinoid metabolism ( edit ) Insulin is a major regulator of endocannabinoid ( EC ) metabolism and insulin treatment has been shown to reduce intracellular ECs , the 2 - arachidonylglycerol ( 2 - AG ) and anandamide ( AEA ) , which correspond with insulin - sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism . In insulin - resistant adipocytes , patterns of insulin - induced enzyme expression is disturbed in a manner consistent with elevated EC synthesis and reduced EC degradation . Findings suggest that insulin - resistant adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation , whereby obese insulin - resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs . This dysregulation contributes to excessive visceral fat accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from abdominal adipose tissue , and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes . Hypoglycemia ( edit ) Main article : Hypoglycemia Although other cells can use other fuels ( most prominently fatty acids ) , neurons depend on glucose as a source of energy , unless the person is in ketosis . They do not require insulin to absorb glucose , unlike muscle and adipose tissue , and they have very small internal stores of glycogen . Glycogen stored in liver cells ( unlike glycogen stored in muscle cells ) can be converted to glucose , and released into the blood , when glucose from digestion is low or absent , and the glycerol backbone in triglycerides can also be used to produce blood glucose . Sufficient lack of glucose and scarcity of these sources of glucose can dramatically make itself manifest in the impaired functioning of the central nervous system : dizziness , speech problems , and even loss of consciousness . Low blood glucose level is known as hypoglycemia or , in cases producing unconsciousness , `` hypoglycemic coma '' ( sometimes termed `` insulin shock '' from the most common causative agent ) . Endogenous causes of insulin excess ( such as an insulinoma ) are very rare , and the overwhelming majority of insulin excess - induced hypoglycemia cases are iatrogenic and usually accidental . A few cases of murder , attempted murder , or suicide using insulin overdoses have been reported , but most insulin shocks appear to be due to errors in dosage of insulin ( e.g. , 20 units instead of 2 ) or other unanticipated factors ( did not eat as much as anticipated , or exercised more than expected , or unpredicted kinetics of the subcutaneously injected insulin itself ) . Possible causes of hypoglycemia include : External insulin ( usually injected subcutaneously ) Oral hypoglycemic agents ( e.g. , any of the sulfonylureas , or similar drugs , which increase insulin release from \u03b2 - cells in response to a particular blood glucose level ) Ingestion of low - carbohydrate sugar substitutes in people without diabetes or with type 2 diabetes . Animal studies show these can trigger insulin release , albeit in much smaller quantities than sugar , according to a report in Discover magazine , August 2004 , p 18 . ( This can never be a cause of hypoglycemia in patients with mature type 1 diabetes , since there is no endogenous insulin production to stimulate . It can occur during the honeymoon period , a period up to several years after a type 1 diabetes diagnosis during which endogenous insulin production still occurs . ) Diseases and syndromes ( edit ) There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic : Diabetes mellitus -- general term referring to all states characterized by hyperglycemia Type 1 -- autoimmune - mediated destruction of insulin - producing \u03b2 - cells in the pancreas , resulting in absolute insulin deficiency Type 2 -- either inadequate insulin production by the \u03b2 - cells or insulin resistance or both because of reasons not completely understood . there is correlation with diet , with sedentary lifestyle , with obesity , with age and with metabolic syndrome . Causality has been demonstrated in multiple model organisms including mice and monkeys ; Importantly , non-obese people do get Type 2 diabetes due to diet , sedentary lifestyle and unknown risk factors . it is likely that there is genetic susceptibility to develop Type 2 diabetes under certain environmental conditions Other types of impaired glucose tolerance ( see the Diabetes ) Insulinoma -- a tumor of beta cells producing excess insulin or reactive hypoglycemia . Metabolic syndrome -- a poorly understood condition first called Syndrome X by Gerald Reaven . It is currently not clear whether the syndrome has a single , treatable cause , or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes . It is characterized by elevated blood pressure , dyslipidemia ( disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids ) , and increased waist circumference ( at least in populations in much of the developed world ) . The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes , which is a diminished capacity for insulin response in some tissues ( e.g. , muscle , fat ) . It is common for morbidities such as essential hypertension , obesity , type 2 diabetes , and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) to develop . Polycystic ovary syndrome -- a complex syndrome in women in the reproductive years where anovulation and androgen excess are commonly displayed as hirsutism . In many cases of PCOS , insulin resistance is present . Medical uses ( edit ) Main article : Insulin ( medication ) A vial of insulin . It has been given a trade name , Actrapid , by the manufacturer . Biosynthetic human insulin ( insulin human rDNA , INN ) for clinical use is manufactured by recombinant DNA technology . Biosynthetic human insulin has increased purity when compared with extractive animal insulin , enhanced purity reducing antibody formation . Researchers have succeeded in introducing the gene for human insulin into plants as another method of producing insulin ( `` biopharming '' ) in safflower . This technique is anticipated to reduce production costs . Several analogs of human insulin are available . These insulin analogs are closely related to the human insulin structure , and were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action ( prandial insulins ) and long action ( basal insulins ) . The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime ( prandial insulin ) , Humalog ( insulin lispro ) , it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin , with an effect 15 minutes after injection . Other rapid - acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra , with similar profiles . All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers ( monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed ) . Fast acting insulins do not require the injection - to - meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins . The other type is long acting insulin ; the first of these was Lantus ( insulin glargine ) . These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24 hours . Likewise , another protracted insulin analogue ( Levemir ) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach . A myristic acid molecule is attached to this analogue , which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin , which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia . Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily , and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin . A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available , making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body  \u0301 s own insulin release . Insulin is usually taken as subcutaneous injections by single - use syringes with needles , via an insulin pump , or by repeated - use insulin pens with disposable needles . Inhaled insulin is also available in the U.S. market now . Synthetic insulin can trigger adverse effects , so some people with diabetes rely on animal - source insulin . Unlike many medicines , insulin currently can not be taken orally because , like nearly all other proteins introduced into the gastrointestinal tract , it is reduced to fragments , whereupon all activity is lost . There has been some research into ways to protect insulin from the digestive tract , so that it can be administered orally or sublingually . History of Study ( edit ) Discovery ( edit ) In 1869 , while studying the structure of the pancreas under a microscope , Paul Langerhans , a medical student in Berlin , identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas . The function of the `` little heaps of cells '' , later known as the islets of Langerhans , initially remained unknown , but Edouard Laguesse later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion . Paul Langerhans ' son , Archibald , also helped to understand this regulatory role . The term `` insulin '' originates from insula , the Latin word for islet \/ island . In 1889 , the physician Oskar Minkowski , in collaboration with Joseph von Mering , removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion . On testing the urine , they found sugar , establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes . In 1901 , another major step was taken by the American physician and scientist Eugene Lindsay Opie , when he isolated the role of the pancreas to the islets of Langerhans : `` Diabetes mellitus when the result of a lesion of the pancreas is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed '' . The structure of insulin . The left side is a space - filling model of the insulin monomer , believed to be biologically active . Carbon is green , hydrogen white , oxygen red , and nitrogen blue . On the right side is a ribbon diagram of the insulin hexamer , believed to be the stored form . A monomer unit is highlighted with the A chain in blue and the B chain in cyan . Yellow denotes disulfide bonds , and magenta spheres are zinc ions . Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate the islets ' secretions . In 1906 George Ludwig Zuelzer achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract , but he was unable to continue his work . Between 1911 and 1912 , E.L. Scott at the University of Chicago tried aqueous pancreatic extracts and noted `` a slight diminution of glycosuria '' , but was unable to convince his director of his work 's value ; it was shut down . Israel Kleiner demonstrated similar effects at Rockefeller University in 1915 , but World War I interrupted his work and he did not return to it . In 1916 , Nicolae Paulescu developed an aqueous pancreatic extract which , when injected into a diabetic dog , had a normalizing effect on blood - sugar levels . He had to interrupt his experiments because of World War I , and in 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in Bucharest and his tests on a diabetic dog . Later that year , he published `` Research on the Role of the Pancreas in Food Assimilation '' . Extraction and purification ( edit ) In October 1920 , Canadian Frederick Banting concluded that the digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied were breaking down the islet secretion , thereby making it impossible to extract successfully . A surgeon by training , Banting knew certain arteries could be tied off that would lead most of the pancreas to atrophy , while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact . He reasoned that a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone . He jotted a note to himself : `` Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog . Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets . Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosuria . '' In the spring of 1921 , Banting traveled to Toronto to explain his idea to J.J.R. Macleod , Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto . Macleod was initially skeptical , since Banting had no background in research and was not familiar with the latest literature , but he agreed to provide lab space for Banting to test out his ideas . Macleod also arranged for two undergraduates to be Banting 's lab assistants that summer , but Banting required only one lab assistant . Charles Best and Clark Noble flipped a coin ; Best won the coin toss and took the first shift . This proved unfortunate for Noble , as Banting keep Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and credit for the discovery with Best . On 30 July 1921 , Banting and Best successfully isolated an extract ( `` isleton '' ) from the islets of a duct - tied dog and injected it into a diabetic dog , finding that the extract reduced its blood sugar by 40 % in 1 hour . Banting and Best presented their results to Macleod on his return to Toronto in the fall of 1921 , but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design , and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment . He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants . Several weeks later , the second round of experiments was also a success , and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November . Bottlenecked by the time - consuming task of duct - tying dogs and waiting several weeks to extract insulin , Banting hit upon the idea of extracting insulin from the fetal calf pancreas , which had not yet developed digestive glands . By December , they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas . Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin . He invited biochemist James Collip to help with this task , and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month . On January 11 , 1922 , Leonard Thompson , a 14 - year - old diabetic who lay dying at the Toronto General Hospital , was given the first injection of insulin . However , the extract was so impure that Thompson suffered a severe allergic reaction , and further injections were canceled . Over the next 12 days , Collip worked day and night to improve the ox - pancreas extract . A second dose was injected on January 23 , completely eliminating the glycosuria that was typical of diabetes without causing any obvious side - effects . The first American patient was Elizabeth Hughes , the daughter of U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes . The first patient treated in the U.S. was future woodcut artist James D. Havens ; Dr. John Ralston Williams imported insulin from Toronto to Rochester , New York , to treat Havens . Banting and Best never worked well with Collip , regarding him as something of an interloper , and Collip left the project soon after . Over the spring of 1922 , Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand , but the preparation remained impure . The drug firm Eli Lilly and Company had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921 , and they took Lilly up on the offer in April . In November , Lilly 's head chemist , George B. Walden discovered isoelectric precipitation and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin . Shortly thereafter , insulin was offered for sale to the general public . Synthesis ( edit ) Purified animal - sourced insulin was initially the only type of insulin available to diabetics . The amino acid structure of insulin was characterized in the early 1950s by Frederick Sanger , and the first synthetic insulin was produced simultaneously in the labs of Panayotis Katsoyannis at the University of Pittsburgh and Helmut Zahn at RWTH Aachen University in the early 1960s . Synthetic crystalline bovine insulin was achieved by Chinese researchers in 1965 . The first genetically engineered , synthetic `` human '' insulin was produced using E. coli in 1978 by Arthur Riggs and Keiichi Itakura at the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope in collaboration with Herbert Boyer at Genentech . Genentech , founded by Swanson , Boyer and Eli Lilly and Company , went on in 1982 to sell the first commercially available biosynthetic human insulin under the brand name Humulin . The vast majority of insulin currently used worldwide is now biosynthetic recombinant `` human '' insulin or its analogues . Recombinant insulin is produced either in yeast ( usually Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) or E. coli . In yeast , insulin may be engineered as a single - chain protein with a KexII endoprotease ( a yeast homolog of PCI \/ PCII ) site that separates the insulin A chain from a c - terminally truncated insulin B chain . A chemically synthesized c - terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin ; typically the lysine on the c - terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis . The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with c - terminal modifications ( e.g. lispro , aspart , glulisine ) . The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by Bruce Merrifield are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low , primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain . Nobel Prizes ( edit ) Frederick Banting joined by Charles Best in office , 1924 The Nobel Prize committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the University of Toronto and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men : Frederick Banting and J.J.R. Macleod . They were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923 for the discovery of insulin . Banting , insulted that Best was not mentioned , shared his prize with him , and Macleod immediately shared his with James Collip . The patent for insulin was sold to the University of Toronto for one half - dollar . Two other Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on insulin . British molecular biologist Frederick Sanger determined the primary structure of insulin in 1955 , making it the first protein to be sequenced . Sanger was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work . Rosalyn Sussman Yalow received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the radioimmunoassay for insulin . Several Nobel Prizes also have an indirect connection with insulin . George Minot , co-recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize for the development of the first effective treatment for pernicious anemia , had diabetes mellitus . Dr. William Castle observed that the 1921 discovery of insulin , arriving in time to keep Minot alive , was therefore also responsible for the discovery of a cure for pernicious anemia . Dorothy Hodgkin was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of crystallography . In 1969 , after decades of work , Hopkins determined the spatial conformation of insulin , the so - called tertiary structure , by means of X-ray diffraction studies . Controversy ( edit ) Nicolae Paulescu The work published by Banting , Best , Collip and Macleod represented the preparation of purified insulin extract suitable for use on human patients . Although Paulescu discovered the principles of the treatment , his saline extract could not be used on humans ; he was not mentioned in the 1923 Nobel Prize . Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct `` the historical wrong '' against Nicolae Paulescu . Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in Glasgow , Scotland , the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital , vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes , and a founding member of the International Diabetes Federation . Murray wrote : Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulescu , the distinguished Romanian scientist , who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs . In a private communication , Professor Arne Tiselius , former head of the Nobel Institute , expressed his personal opinion that Paulescu was equally worthy of the award in 1923 .

Over several encounters with Evelyn , Ninny tells her the story of the now abandoned town of Whistle Stop , and the people who lived there . The film 's subplot concerns Evelyn 's dissatisfaction with her marriage , her life , her growing confidence , and her developing friendship with Ninny . The narrative switches several times between Ninny 's story , which is set between World War I and World War II , and Evelyn 's life in 1980s Birmingham . Ninny 's story begins with tomboy Idgie Threadgoode , the youngest of the Threadgoode children , whom Ninny describes as her sister - in - law . Idgie 's close relationship with her charming older brother , Buddy , is cut short when he is hit by a train and killed . Devastated , she recedes from formal society for much of her childhood and adolescence until Buddy 's former girlfriend , the straitlaced Ruth Jamison , intervenes at the request of the concerned Threadgoode family . Idgie initially resists Ruth 's attempts at friendship , but gradually a deep attachment develops between them . Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett and moves to Valdosta , Georgia . Idgie tries to forget her but later visits her house to find her pregnant and subject to physical abuse from Frank . Against his wishes and violent attempts to stop her , she returns to Whistle Stop with Idgie , where her baby , a boy whom she names Buddy , Jr. , is born . Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business so she can care for Ruth and Buddy , Jr . She and Ruth open the Whistle Stop Cafe , employing the family cook , Sipsey , and her son , Big George , who excels with a barbecue that becomes popular with their patrons . Frank eventually returns to Whistle Stop to kidnap Buddy , Jr. , but his attempt is thwarted by an unseen assailant , and he is later reported missing . Once his truck appears at the bottom of a nearby drying lake without its owner , Idgie is immediately a suspect , as she had publicly threatened violence against him for beating Ruth . She is detained along with Big George for his murder by Grady Kilgore , the local sheriff , who offers to release her and pin the crime solely on Big George ; she refuses to sacrifice him . During the subsequent trial , the local minister , Reverend Scroggins , has no problem lying , providing Idgie and Big George with sound alibi for the time of Frank 's disappearance . Taking into account his reputation for getting drunk , the judge rules his death an accident and dismisses the case . Idgie and Big George are cleared of all charges . After the trial , Ruth is diagnosed with cancer , becomes very ill , and eventually dies . Following her death , the caf\u00e9 closes . Over time , many Whistle Stop residents eventually move away , bringing Ninny to the end of her story , but not before the revelation of what really happened to Frank . Sipsey killed him with a blow to the head with a heavy cast iron frying pan while trying to prevent him from kidnapping Buddy , Jr . Idgie got Big George to barbecue Frank 's body , which was later served to an investigator from Georgia searching for him . The investigator ate with gusto , proclaiming his meal the best pork barbecue he 'd ever tasted . Evelyn discovers that during Ninny 's temporary stay at the nursing home , her house was condemned and torn down . Evelyn , having become friends with her , offers her a room in her house which she accepts . As they walk away from the empty lot where her house used to be , they pass Ruth 's grave , freshly adorned with a jar of honey , a honeycomb , and a card which reads , `` I 'll always love you , the Bee Charmer '' . The Bee Charmer is Ruth 's old nickname for Idgie , and the note reveals that she is still alive . Cast ( edit ) Kathy Bates as Evelyn Couch Mary Stuart Masterson & Nancy Moore Atchison as Imogene `` Idgie '' Threadgoode Mary - Louise Parker as Ruth Jamison Jessica Tandy as Ninny Threadgoode Cicely Tyson as Sipsey Chris O'Donnell as Buddy Threadgoode Stan Shaw as Big George Gailard Sartain as Ed Couch Timothy Scott as Smokey Lonesome Gary Basaraba as Grady Kilgore Lois Smith as Mama Threadgoode Danny Nelson as Papa Threadgoode Jo Harvey Allen as Women 's Awareness Teacher Macon McCalman as Prosecutor Richard Riehle as Reverend Scroggins Raynor Scheine as Curtis Smoot Grace Zabriskie as Eva Bates Reid Binion as Young Julian Nick Searcy as Frank Bennett Constance Shulman as Missy Differences between the film and novel ( edit ) Unlike the novel , the film does not make the lesbian romance between the two central characters explicit , instead leaving the relationship between Idgie and Ruth ambiguous . The DVD contains an audio commentary in which the director acknowledges the relationship and points out that a scene between Idgie and Ruth engaging in a food fight was intended to be seen as symbolic love - making . At the time of the film 's debut , it was criticized by reviewers and activists for what was seen as `` glossing over '' the lesbian relationship . However , it won an award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation for best feature film with lesbian content . It shows examples of discrimination against African Americans , women , and the disabled , but the novel 's examination of sexuality - based prejudice through a robust lesbian plot , is made more ambiguous . Though in the book , Idgie and Ninny are two separate characters , at the end of the film it 's largely hinted that they are one and the same , although this runs counter to Ninny 's earlier comment that `` I was practically adopted by the Threadgoodes ; I married her ( Idgie 's ) brother , Cleo '' . Production ( edit ) Conception and casting ( edit ) Avnet first read the novel in 1987 . He was introduced to it by producer Lisa Lindstrom , with whom he worked on television films Heat Wave and Breaking Point . Although he wanted her to give him a synopsis of the story , she insisted he read the book and like her , he loved it . He decided to turn the story into a film and pitched the idea to Norman Lear 's company , Act III Communications , who were interested and gave him a small budget for a screenwriter . He hired Carol Sobieski who had written the screenplay for 1982 's Annie . She wrote a draft for it as a musical , which he was unhappy with . Sobieski left the project and he hired Flagg , who had been surprised that anyone would want to turn the novel into a film , to develop the script . Although she had some screenwriting experience , she found the process of turning her own novel into a script a strange one . The job was made somewhat easier by the work done by Sobieski and Avnet in choosing which characters from the book were going to be featured , but she found it difficult and also left the project , after writing 70 pages of the screenplay . With no money left to hire another writer , Avnet took the script over himself and spent the next 2 -- 3 years developing it . Flagg gave her blessing to the final draft . Avnet wrote the film with Jessica Tandy in mind ; she expressed excitement about making the film . He had worked with Kathy Bates and Chris O'Donnell on the 1990 film Men Do n't Leave before offering them the roles of Evelyn Couch and Buddy Threadgoode respectively . When Bates read the script she loved the characters and was particularly keen to work with Tandy . Mary - Louise Parker was casting director David Rubin 's first choice for the role of Ruth Jamison . She read for the part several times , initially unhappy with her own tests . When she read along with Mary Stuart Masterson , they -- and the producers -- agreed that they had good chemistry . Setting ( edit ) Inside the Whistle Stop Cafe , Juliette , Georgia . Avnet hired Barbara Ling as production designer . Scouting for a location , she found Juliette , Georgia , a town that was , according to Avnet , nearly deserted . The building chosen to be the Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9 was formerly an antique and hardware store . It was redesigned as a cafe , with a horseshoe shaped counter to allow for optimal camera angles . After the release of the film , Juliette saw an influx of tourists and , with Jon Avnet 's encouragement , locals opened the Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9 , recreated to mirror the film set . Although `` Whistle Stop Caf\u00e9 '' is now a registered trademark , other establishments have appeared using that name . While writing the novel , Flagg based Whistle Stop on Irondale , Alabama , and the caf\u00e9 on a real - life restaurant , the Irondale Caf\u00e9 . She was a frequent visitor there which was formerly owned by her great - aunt . The scene where Idgie goes to collect honey from a beehive for Ruth was originally intended to be performed by a stunt double . However , after the latter backed out at the last minute , Masterson volunteered to do it herself . The footage of her covered in a swarm of live bees is seen in the final version of the film . The steam locomotive used in the film is A&WP 290 , then in use pulling steam excursions for the New Georgia Railroad . Release ( edit ) The film was given a limited release in the US on December 27 , 1991 , opening in five theaters . It got a wide release four weeks later on January 24 , 1992 , in 673 theaters . It ran for 19 weeks in total , with its widest release having been 1,331 theaters . Reception ( edit ) Box office ( edit ) The film grossed a total of $82,418,501 in the United States alone , and took in $37,000,000 outside the US , bringing the total to $119,418,501 worldwide . In its opening weekend it earned $105,317 , and at its wide release opening weekend it earned $5,235,940 , which was 6.4 percent of its total gross . According to Box Office Mojo , it ranked at no . 11 for all films released in the US in 1991 , and no . 5 for PG \u2010 13 rated films released that year . Critical reception ( edit ) The film was generally well received by critics . Film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gave it a `` fresh '' score of 73 % based on 41 reviews . Critics enjoyed the narrative , but found it conventional and predictable . The adaptation of the separate narrative of book to the screen was criticised by Time Out as `` clumsy '' , Roger Ebert praised the performances , Janet Maslin praised the costume and production design and Emanuel Levy praised the cinematography and score . The cast drew praise for their performances , particularly Masterson and Tandy . Awards and honors ( edit ) The film was nominated at the 64th Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Supporting Role ( Jessica Tandy ) and for Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium ( Fannie Flagg and Carol Sobieski ) . At the 46th British Academy Film Awards in 1992 , Tandy was nominated for the Best Actress award , and Bates was nominated as Best Actress in a Supporting Role . Both also received Golden Globe nominations for their work , and the film got a Best Picture ( Comedy or Musical ) nomination . At the 28th Guldbagge Awards in Sweden , it was nominated for the Best Foreign Film award .

( December 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Sanctification is the act or process of acquiring sanctity , of being made or becoming holy . It is a gift given through the power of God to a person or thing which is then considered sacred or set apart in an official capacity within the religion . In general anything from a temple , to vessels , to days of the week , to a human believer who willingly accepts this gift can be sanctified . To sanctify is to literally `` set apart for particular use in a special purpose or work and to make holy or sacred . '' Etymologically , `` sanctify '' derives from the Latin verb sanctificare which in turn derives from sanctus `` holy '' and facere `` to make '' .

The specific problem is : theological superficiality of the section , failing to recognize deeper commonalities and differences that would lead to different groupings than appear , including but not limited to the admixture of Protestant and non-Protestant faiths ( through the alphabetical listing ) , and the presentation of some Arminian understandings separate from others . WikiProject Christianity or WikiProject Christian theology may be able to help recruit an expert . ( December 2016 ) In the various branches of Christianity sanctification usually refers to a person becoming holy , with the details differing in different branches . Anglicanism ( edit ) A 2002 Anglican publishing house book states that `` there is no explicit teaching on sanctification in the Anglican formularies '' . A glossary of the Episcopal Church ( USA ) gives some teaching : `` Anglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God 's work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life . '' Outside official formularies sanctification has been an issue in the Anglican Communion since its inception . The 16th century Anglican Theologian Richard Hooker ( 1554 - 1600 ) distinguished between the `` righteousness of justification '' that is imputed by God and the `` righteousness of sanctification '' that comprises the works one does as an `` inevitable '' result of being justified . Jeremy Taylor ( 1613 - 1667 ) argued that justification and sanctification can not be separated ; they are `` two steps in a long process '' . A 19th century Church of England work agreed with Jeremy Taylor that justification and sanctification are `` inseparable '' . However , they are not the same thing . Justification is `` found in Christ 's work alone '' . `` Sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in us , and is a progressive work . '' Calvinism ( edit ) Calvinist and Evangelical theologians interpret sanctification as the process of being made holy only through the merits and justification of Jesus Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit that are then reflected in man . Sanctification can not be attained by any works based process , but only through the works and power of the divine . When a man is unregenerate , it is his essence that sins and does evil . But when a man is justified through Christ , it is no longer the man ( in his essence ) that sins , but the man is acting outside of his character . In other words , the man is not being himself , he is not being true to who he is . Eastern orthodoxy ( edit ) Orthodox Christianity teaches the doctrine of theosis , whereby humans take on divine properties . A key scripture supporting this is 2 Peter 1 : 4 . In the 4th century , Athanasius taught that God became Man that Man might become God . Essentially , Man does not become divine , but in Christ can partake of divine nature . This Church 's version of salvation restores God 's image in man . One such theme is release from mortality caused by desires of the world . Lutheranism ( edit ) Martin Luther , the founder of Lutheranism , taught in his Large Catechism that Sanctification is only caused by the Holy Spirit through the powerful Word of God . The Holy Spirit uses churches to gather Christians together for the teaching and preaching of the Word of God . Sanctification is the Holy Spirit 's work of making us holy . When the Holy Spirit creates faith in us , he renews in us the image of God so that through his power we produce good works . These good works are not meritorious but show the faith in our hearts ( Ephesians 2 : 8 - 10 , James 2 : 18 ) . Sanctification flows from justification . It is an on - going process which will not be complete or reach perfection in this life . Methodist ( edit ) In Wesleyan - Arminian theology , which is upheld by the Methodist Church as well as by Holiness Churches , `` sanctification , the beginning of holiness , begins at the new birth '' . With the Grace of God , Methodists `` do works of piety and mercy , and these works reflect the power of sanctification '' . Examples of these means of grace ( works of piety and works of mercy ) that aid with sanctification include frequent reception of the sacrament of Holy Communion ( work of piety ) , and visiting the sick and those in prison ( work of mercy ) . Wesleyan covenant theology also emphasizes that an important aspect of sanctification is the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments . As such , in `` sanctification one grows to be more like Christ . '' This process of sanctification that begins at the new birth ( first work of grace ) has its goal as Christian perfection , also known as entire sanctification ( second work of grace ) , which John Wesley , the progenitor of the Methodist faith , described as a heart `` habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor '' and as `` having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked '' . This is the doctrine that by the power of God 's sanctifying grace and attention upon the means of grace may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of original sin in this life . It is expounded upon in the Methodist Articles of Religion : Sanctification is that renewal of our fallen nature by the Holy Ghost , received through faith in Jesus Christ , whose blood of atonement cleanseth from all sin ; whereby we are not only delivered from the guilt of sin , but are washed from its pollution , saved from its power , and are enabled , through grace , to love God with all our hearts and to walk in his holy commandments blameless . Justification is seen as an initial step of acknowledging God 's holiness , with sanctification as , through the grace and power of God , entering into it . A key scripture is Hebrews 12 : 14 : `` Follow after ... holiness , without which no one shall see the Lord . '' The Wesleyan Church ( formerly known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church ) states that sanctification has three components -- initial , progressive , and entire : We believe that sanctification is that work of the Holy Spirit by which the child of God is separated from sin unto God and is enabled to love God with all the heart and to walk in all His holy commandments blameless . Sanctification is initiated at the moment of justification and regeneration . From that moment there is a gradual or progressive sanctification as the believer walks with God and daily grows in grace and in a more perfect obedience to God . This prepares for the crisis of entire sanctification which is wrought instantaneously when believers present themselves as living sacrifices , holy and acceptable to God , through faith in Jesus Christ , being effected by the baptism with the Holy Spirit who cleanses the heart from all inbred sin . The crisis of entire sanctification perfects the believer in love and empowers that person for effective service . It is followed by lifelong growth in grace and the knowledge of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ . The life of holiness continues through faith in the sanctifying blood of Christ and evidences itself by loving obedience to God 's revealed will . John Wesley taught that outward holiness in the form of `` right words and right actions '' should reflect the inner transformation experienced through the second work of grace . Roman catholicism ( edit ) The Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of sanctification , teaching that : Sanctifying grace is that grace which confers on our souls a new life , that is , sharing in the life of God . Our reconciliation with God , which the redemption of Christ has merited for us , finds its accomplishments in sanctifying grace . Through this most precious gift we participate in the divine life ; we have the right to be called children of God . This grace is the source of all our supernatural merits and bestows upon us the right of eternal glory . According to the Catholic Encyclopedia `` sanctity '' differs for God , individual , and corporate body . For God , it is God 's unique absolute moral perfection . For the individual , it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection . It is essentially of God , by a divine gift . For a society , it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members , who display a real , not merely nominal , holiness . The Church 's holiness is beyond human power , beyond natural power . Sanctity is regulated by established conventional standards . Other Christian denominations and movements ( edit ) Beliefs about sanctification vary amongst the Christian denominations and movements , influenced by various Christian movements . These beliefs differ from each other on : whether sanctification is a definitive experience or process , when the process \/ experience takes place , and if entire sanctification is possible in this life . Influenced by the Holiness movement some Pentecostal churches , such as the Church of God in Christ and the Apostolic Faith Church , believe that sanctification is a definitive act of God 's grace and spiritual experience whereby we are made holy subsequent to salvation and prior to the baptism of the Holy Spirit . Reformed Churches are amongst denominations that teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion , and believers are required to `` do good works '' which are `` ... all sanctified by ( God 's ) grace '' . Similarly , non-Wesleyan Pentecostals such as Assemblies of God teach about definitive sanctification at the time of conversion and progressive sanctification after conversion . Converted believers are expected to `` make every effort to live a holy life ... Even though Christians may not attain absolute perfection in this life . '' The event of entire sanctification occurs when Christ comes back and gives us glorified bodies . Higher Life movement and Brunstad Christian Church believe that sinless perfection is attainable in Christian life . Higher Life movement teaches that even though believers still have an inclination to sin after conversion , they must constantly rely on the Holy Spirit to struggle against this tendency , and therefore can attain sinless perfection in this life . Further , the movement proclaims that `` the secret of complete victory is faith : simply believing that Jesus has done and is doing all '' . On the contrary , Brunstad Christian Church teaches that because Jesus , as a man , was tempted in all points as other human beings , yet never committed sin , he opened a way back to God , and therefore those who want to be disciples can follow on that same way . They proclaim that this means a Christian does not only receive the forgiveness of sins , but can also conquer all sinful tendencies in their own human nature .

( December 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS Church ) sanctification is a process and gift from God which makes every willing member holy , according to their repentance and righteous efforts , through the Savior Jesus Christ 's matchless grace . To become Sanctified , or Holy , one must do all that he can to live as Christ lived , according to the teachings of Christ . One must strive to live a holy life to truly be considered Holy . In the scriptural canon of the LDS Church , one reference to sanctification appears in Helaman 3 : 35 , in the Book of Mormon : Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft , and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility , and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ , unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation , yea , even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts , which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God . Dallin H. Oaks , an LDS General authority and member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has written to expand on the meaning of sanctity .

If the notion of perfection is offensive , it is also biblical : Jesus taught us to `` Be perfect , therefore as your heavenly Father is perfect '' ( Matthew 5 : 48 ) . And to what perfection can human beings aspire ? Methodists have always answered this by repeating the Great Commandment : `` You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind '' ( Matthew 22 : 37 ; cf . Mark 12 : 30 , Luke 10 : 27 ) . Along with this , Methodists insist that Christian perfection also means the fulfillment of the second Commandment : love of our neighbor . Thus , Christian perfection or entire sanctification denotes primarily the perfection of our love for God and for our neighbor . Jump up ^ `` Distinctive Wesleyan Emphases ( Page 2 ) '' .

{"document_plaintext":"Finances of the British Royal family - wikipedia Finances of the British Royal family The British royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the annual Trooping the Colour in 2013 The finances of the British royal family come from a number of sources . The UK Parliament supports the monarch and other members of the royal household financially by means of the Sovereign Grant , a percentage of the annual profits of the Crown Estate which is intended to meet the costs of the sovereign 's official expenditures . This includes the costs of the upkeep of the various royal residences , staffing , travel and state visits , public engagements , and official entertainment . Other sources of income include revenues from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall , a parliamentary annuity , and income from private investments . The Keeper of the Privy Purse is Head of the Privy Purse and Treasurer 's Office and has overall responsibility for the management of the sovereign 's financial affairs . Contents ( hide ) 1 Income 1.1 Civil List 1.2 Sovereign Grant 1.3 Duchy of Lancaster 1.4 Duchy of Cornwall 1.5 Parliamentary annuities 1.6 Taxation 2 Assets 2.1 Private wealth of the Queen 2.2 Crown Estate 2.3 Assets held in trust 3 References Income ( edit ) Civil List ( edit ) Main article : Civil list Until 1760 the monarch met all official expenses from hereditary revenues , which included the profits of the Crown Estate ( the royal property portfolio ) . King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the Civil List . Under this arrangement the Crown Estate remained the property of the sovereign , but the hereditary revenues of the crown were placed at the disposal of the House of Commons . The Civil List was paid from public funds and was intended to support the exercise of the monarch 's duties as head of state of the United Kingdom . This arrangement persisted from 1760 until 2012 . In modern times , the Government 's profits from the Crown Estate always significantly exceeded the Civil List . Under the Civil List arrangements the royal family faced criticism for the lack of transparency surrounding Royal finances . The National Audit Office was not entitled to audit the Royal Household . The Queen received an annual \u00a3 7.9 million a year from the Civil List between 2001 and 2012 . The total income of the Royal Household from the Treasury was always significantly larger than the Civil List because it included additional income such as Grants - in - Aid from the Treasury and revenues from the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster . The total Royal Household income for the financial years 2011 -- 12 and 2012 -- 13 was \u00a3 30 million per annum , followed by a 14 % cut in the following year . However , the Treasury provided an additional \u00a3 1 million to pay for Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 . Royal expenditure differs from income due to the use of a Reserve Fund , which can be added to or drawn from . The official reported annual expenditure of the Head of State was \u00a3 41.5 million for the 2008 -- 09 financial year . This figure did not include the cost of security provided by the police and the Army and some other expenses . Sovereign Grant ( edit ) Main article : Sovereign Grant Act 2011 Under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 , the system of funding the Royal Household by a mixture of Civil List payments and Grants - in - Aid was replaced . From 1 April 2012 a single annual Sovereign Grant has been paid by the Treasury . The level of funding for the Royal Household is now linked to the Government 's revenue from The Crown Estate . The Sovereign Grant Annual Report states that the Sovereign Grant was \u00a3 31 million for 2012 - 13 , \u00a3 36.1 million for 2013 - 14 and \u00a3 37.9 million for 2014 - 15 . The amount of the Sovereign Grant is 15 % of the income account net surplus of the Crown Estate for the financial year that began two years previously . The arrangements will be reviewed by 2016 ( subsection 7 ( 5 ) of the Act ) . Step 4 of subsection 6 ( 1 ) , and subsection 6 ( 4 ) , of the Act provide a mechanism to prevent the amount of the Sovereign Grant increasing beyond what is necessary because of the growth in Crown Estate revenue . Under the Sovereign Grant the National Audit Office is able to audit the Royal Household . On November 18 , 2016 a plan was announced to increase the Sovereign Grant from 15 % to 25 % to renovate and repair Buckingham Palace . The percentage is set to revert to 15 % when the project is finished in 2027 . Duchy of Lancaster ( edit ) Main article : Duchy of Lancaster The Duchy of Lancaster is the private estate of the British Sovereign ( now Queen Elizabeth II ) consisting of land holdings and other assets . As it is held in perpetual trust for future generations of Sovereigns , the Sovereign is not entitled to the estate 's capital . The revenue profits of the Duchy are presented to the Sovereign each year and form part of the Privy Purse , providing income for both the official and private expenses of the monarch . In the financial year ending 31 March 2015 , the Duchy was valued at \u00a3 472 million , providing \u00a3 16 million in income . In 2017 , the Paradise Papers revealed that the Duchy held investments in two offshore financial centres , the Cayman Islands and Bermuda . Both are British Overseas Territories of which Queen Elizabeth II is monarch , and nominally appoints governors . Britain handles foreign policy for both islands to a large extent , but Bermuda has been self - governing since 1620 . The Duchy 's investments included First Quench Retailing off - licences and rent - to - own retailer BrightHouse . Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn posited that the Queen should apologize , saying anyone with money offshore for tax avoidance should `` not just apologise for it , ( but ) recognise what it does to our society '' . A spokesman for the Duchy said that all of their investments are audited and legitimate and that the Queen voluntarily pays taxes on income she receives from Duchy investments . Duchy of Cornwall ( edit ) Main article : Duchy of Cornwall The Duchy of Cornwall is a Crown entity holding land and other assets to produce an income for the monarch 's eldest son . The Duke of Cornwall ( currently , Charles , Prince of Wales ) receives revenue which he applies towards charitable work and official activities , supported by the Queen 's grant - in - aid funding to provide assistance with official travel and property . These financial arrangements also cover the official expenditure of some members of his immediate family . The Duchess of Cornwall , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex all have their official expenses paid from Duchy income , assisted by grants - in aid from the Queen . For the fiscal year 2011 -- 12 the Duchy was valued at \u00a3 728 million with an annual profit of \u00a3 18.3 million paid to the Prince . Parliamentary annuities ( edit ) The Duke of Edinburgh receives a parliamentary annuity of \u00a3 359,000 per year from the Treasury . In the past some other members of the British royal family also received funding in the form of parliamentary annuities . The Civil List Act 1952 provided for an allowance to Princess Margaret as well as allowances to the queen 's younger children among others . The Civil List Act 1972 added further members of the royal family to the annuity list . By 2002 there were eight recipients of parliamentary annuities ( all children or cousins of the Queen ) receiving a combined total of \u00a3 1.5 million annually . Between 1993 and 2012 the Queen voluntarily refunded the cost of these annuities to the Treasury . The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 abolished all of these other than that received by the Duke of Edinburgh . Subsequently , the living costs of the members of the royal family who carry out official duties , including the Princess Royal , the Duke of York , and the Earl and Countess of Wessex , have mainly been met through the Queen 's income from the Duchy of Lancaster . Taxation ( edit ) The Crown has a legal tax - exempt status because certain acts of parliament do not apply to it . Crown bodies such as The Duchy of Lancaster are not subject to legislation concerning income tax , capital gains tax or inheritance tax . Furthermore , the Sovereign has no legal liability to pay such taxes . The Duchy of Cornwall has a Crown exemption and the Prince of Wales is not legally liable to pay income tax on Duchy revenues . A `` Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation '' was published on 5 February 1993 and amended in 1996 , 2009 and 2013 . It is intended that the arrangements in the memorandum will be followed by the next monarch . The memorandum describes the arrangements by which The Queen and The Prince of Wales make voluntary payments to the HM Revenue and Customs in lieu of tax to compensate for their tax exemption . The details of the payments are private . The Queen voluntarily pays a sum equivalent to income tax on her private income and income from the Privy Purse ( which includes the Duchy of Lancaster ) that is not used for official purposes . The Sovereign Grant is exempted . A sum equivalent to capital gains tax is voluntarily paid on any gains from the disposal of private assets made after 5 April 1993 . Many of the Sovereign 's assets were acquired earlier than this date but payment is only made on the gains made afterwards . Arrangements also exist for a sum in lieu of inheritance tax to be voluntarily paid on some of the Queen 's private assets . Property passing from monarch to monarch is exempted , as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch . The Prince of Wales voluntarily pays a sum equivalent to income tax on that part of his income from the Duchy of Cornwall that is in excess of what is needed to meet official expenditure . From 1969 he made voluntary tax payments of 50 % of the profits , but this reduced to 25 % in 1981 when he married Lady Diana Spencer . These arrangements were replaced by the memorandum in 1993 . The income of the Prince of Wales from sources other than the Duchy of Cornwall is subject to tax in the normal way . Assets ( edit ) Private wealth of the Queen ( edit ) The Queen has a private income from her personal investment portfolio , though her personal wealth and income are not known . Jock Colville , a former private secretary to the Queen ( when she was Princess Elizabeth ) and a director of her bank , Coutts , estimated her wealth at \u00a3 2 million in 1971 ( the equivalent of about \u00a3 26 million today ) . An official statement from Buckingham Palace in 1993 called estimates of \u00a3 100 million `` grossly overstated '' . In 2002 , she inherited her mother 's estate , thought to have been worth \u00a3 70 million ( the equivalent of about \u00a3 105 million today ) . Forbes magazine estimated the Queen 's net worth at around $500 million ( about \u00a3 325 million ) in 2011 , while an analysis by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index put it at $425 million ( about \u00a3 275 million ) in 2015 . In 2012 the Sunday Times estimated the Queen 's wealth as being \u00a3 310 million ( $504 million ) , and that year the Queen received a Guinness World Record as Wealthiest Queen . The Sunday Times Rich List 2015 estimated her wealth at \u00a3 340 million , making her the 302nd richest person in the United Kingdom ; that was the first year she was not among the Sunday Times Rich List 's top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989 . She was number one on the list when it began in 1989 . Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle are privately owned by the Queen . Crown Estate ( edit ) Main article : Crown Estate The Crown Estate is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom , producing \u00a3 211 million for the Treasury in the financial year 2007 -- 8 . and with holdings of \u00a3 7.3 billion in 2011 . The Crown Estate is not the private property of the Monarch . It can not be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity , nor do any revenues , or debts , from the estate accrue to her . Instead the Crown Estate is owned by the Crown , a corporation representing the legal embodiment of the State . It is held in trust and governed by Act of Parliament , to which it makes an annual report . Revenue from the Crown Estate is thought to be due to double in real terms between 2010 and 2020 with additional lease revenues deriving from the development of offshore wind farms within Britain 's Renewable Energy Zone , the rights of which were granted to the Crown Estate by the Energy Act 2004 . Assets held in trust ( edit ) A number of State possessions are held in trust by the Sovereign . The Royal Collection is the art collection of the British royal family . It is one of the largest and most important art collections in the world , containing over 7,000 paintings , 40,000 watercolours and drawings , about 150,000 old master prints , historical photographs , tapestries , furniture , ceramics , books , gold and silver plate , arms and armour , jewellery and other works of art . The collection includes the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London ( including the crown , orb and sceptre ) . It is physically dispersed between thirteen Royal residences and former residences across Britain . Although the collection belongs to the sovereign , it is not the personal property of Elizabeth II as a private individual . Instead the collection is held in trust by the Queen for her successors and the nation . The Treasury refers to these assets as `` vested in the sovereign and can not be alienated '' . Income is generated by the collection from public admissions and other sources . This income is received by the Royal Collection Trust , the collection 's management charity , and not by the Queen . The occupied royal palaces in the United Kingdom such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle are held in trust by the sovereign . The Royal Household is expected to use the Sovereign Grant to maintain the palaces . In May 2009 the Queen requested an extra \u00a3 4 million annually from the government to carry out a backlog of repairs to Buckingham Palace . In 2010 , the Royal Household requested an additional grant from the Department for Culture , Media and Sport but were refused on the basis that the scheme was `` aimed at schools , hospitals , councils and housing associations for heating programmes which benefit low - income families '' . Over a third of the Royal estate was in disrepair by 2012 -- 13 according to a report by the Public Accounts Committee . The cost of restoration was estimated to be \u00a3 50 million , but the Reserve Fund was at a historic low of \u00a3 1m . The Monarch is also responsible for using the Sovereign Grant to pay the wages of 431 of the approximately 1200 Royal Household staff , amounting to \u00a3 18.2 million in 2014 -- 15 . In 2013 , the Guardian newspaper reported that Buckingham Palace was using zero - hour contract for its summer staff and in 2015 it was reported that at least four senior officials had been made redundant to reduce costs .

Ecuador also includes the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in the Pacific , about 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) west of the mainland . The capital city is Quito , while the largest city is Guayaquil . What is now Ecuador was home to a variety of Amerindian groups that were gradually incorporated into the Inca Empire during the 15th century . The territory was colonized by Spain during the 16th century , achieving independence in 1820 as part of Gran Colombia , from which it emerged as its own sovereign state in 1830 . The legacy of both empires is reflected in Ecuador 's ethnically diverse population , with most of its 16.4 million people being mestizos , followed by large minorities of European , Amerindian , and African descendants . Spanish is the official language and is spoken by a majority of the population , though 13 Amerindian languages are also recognized , including Quichua and Shuar . Ecuador is a middle - income country , with a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities , namely petroleum and agricultural products . It is governed as a democratic presidential republic . One of 17 megadiverse countries in the world , Ecuador hosts many endemic plants and animals , such as those of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . In recognition of its unique ecological heritage , the new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature , or ecosystem rights .

Between 100 BC and 100 AD . Found in Esmeraldas Various peoples had settled in the area of the future Ecuador before the arrival of the Incas . The archeological evidence suggests that the Paleo - Indians ' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the last glacial period , around 16,500 -- 13,000 years ago . The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the Pacific Ocean coastline . Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries , others descended from northern South America , and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes . They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups . Even though their languages were unrelated , these groups developed similar groups of cultures , each based in different environments . The people of the coast developed a fishing , hunting , and gathering culture ; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life ; and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting - and - gathering mode of existence . Over time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe , with a similar language and culture . Many civilizations arose in Ecuador , such as the Valdivia Culture and Machalilla Culture on the coast , the Quitus ( near present - day Quito ) , and the Ca\u00f1ari ( near present - day Cuenca ) . Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture , pottery , and religious interests . In the highland Andes mountains , where life was more sedentary , groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages ; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed . Eventually , through wars and marriage alliances of their leaders , a group of nations formed confederations . One region consolidated under a confederation called the Shyris , which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions . Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood - line . Inca era Ruins of Ingapirca , this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops , but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun , the maximum Incan God , thus constituting a Coricancha , dedicated to the Inca ritual . Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the Shuars ( Jivaroan peoples ) . When the Incas arrived , they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers -- Topa Inca Yupanqui and Huayna Capac -- to absorb them into the Inca Empire . The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru , Bolivia , and north Argentina . Similarly , a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion . Thus , the region of highland Ecuador became part of the Inca Empire in 1463 sharing the same language . In contrast , when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador , they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile . Moreover , when the Incas tried to subdue them , these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to guerrilla tactics . As a result , Inca expansion into the Amazon basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered . The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force . The Amazonian people and the Cayapas of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination , maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century . Before the arrival of the Spaniards , the Inca Empire was involved in a civil war . The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac , from a European disease that spread into Ecuador , created a power vacuum between two factions . The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claims that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided . He gave the territories pertaining to present - day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa , who was to rule from Quito ; and he gave the rest to Hu\u00e1scar , who was to rule from Cuzco . He willed that his heart be buried in Quito , his favorite city , and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco . Hu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father 's will , since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests . Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father 's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler . Atahualpa , with a large number of his father 's veteran soldiers , decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar , and a civil war ensued . A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured . Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother . A small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca , where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them . Valverde , the priest , tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain . This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground . At this point the enraged Spaniards , with orders from Valverde , attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa . Pizarro promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold . But , after a mock trial , the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation .

New infectious diseases , endemic to the Europeans , caused high fatalities among the Amerindian population during the first decades of Spanish rule , as they had no immunity . At the same time , the natives were forced into the encomienda labor system for the Spanish . In 1563 , Quito became the seat of a real audiencia ( administrative district ) of Spain and part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and later the Viceroyalty of New Granada . After nearly 300 years of Spanish rule , Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants . On August 10 , 1809 , the city 's criollos called for independence from Spain ( first among the peoples of Latin America ) . They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar , Quiroga , Salinas , and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo . Quito 's nickname , `` Luz de Am\u00e9rica '' ( `` Light of America '' ) , is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent , local government . Although the new government lasted no more than two months , it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America . August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day , a national holiday .

The people were very happy about the independence and celebrated , which is now Ecuador 's independence day , officially on May 24 , 1822 . The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the Battle of Pichincha , near Quito . Following the battle , Ecuador joined Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar 's Republic of Gran Colombia , also including modern - day Colombia , Venezuela and Panama . In 1830 Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic . The 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers . The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan - born Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores , who was ultimately deposed , followed by several authoritarian leaders , such as Vicente Rocafuerte ; Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo ; Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina ; Diego Noboa ; Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta ; Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi ; and Flores 's own son , Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n , among others . The conservative Gabriel Garcia Moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church . In the late 19th century , world demand for cocoa tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast . Ecuador abolished slavery and freed its black slaves in 1851 . Liberal Revolution Antique dug out canoes in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the Historic Center of Quito Main article : Liberal Revolution of 1895 The Liberal Revolution of 1895 under Eloy Alfaro reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners . This liberal wing retained power until the military `` Julian Revolution '' of 1925 . The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians , such as five - time President Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra . Loss of claimed territories since 1830 Main article : History of the Ecuadorian -- Peruvian territorial dispute The Ecuadorian -- Peruvian territorial dispute History of the Ecuadorian -- Peruvian territorial dispute Gran Colombia -- Peru War ( 1828 - 1829 ) Ecuadorian -- Peruvian territorial dispute of 1857 -- 60 Ecuadorian - Peruvian War ( 1941 ) Paquisha War ( 1981 ) Cenepa War ( 1995 ) President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores de jure territorial claims Since Ecuador 's separation from Colombia in May 13 , 1830 , its first President , General Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores , laid claim to the territory that was called the Real Audiencia of Quito , also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito . He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or Real Cedulas , that delineated the borders of Spain 's former overseas colonies . In the case of Ecuador , Flores - based Ecuador 's de jure claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563 , 1739 , and 1740 ; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil ( 1829 ) which Peru reluctantly signed , after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre defeated President and General La Mar 's Peruvian invasion force in the Battle of Tarqui . In addition , Ecuador 's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of Brazil in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the First Treaty of San Ildefonso ( 1777 ) between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire . Moreover , to add legitimacy to his claims , on February 16 , 1840 , Flores signed a treaty with Spain , whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain 's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito . Ecuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors , such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916 , Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties , and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942 . Struggle for independence During the struggle for independence , before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations , a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil , Tumbez , and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain . A few months later , a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito ( Ecuador ) . It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader San Martin wished to liberate present - day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru , since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it . However , Bol\u00edvar 's intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia , out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia , Venezuela , and Ecuador . San Martin 's plans were thwarted when Bol\u00edvar , with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force , descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil ; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of Gran Colombia . This happened a few days before San Martin 's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil , with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito ( Ecuador ) and to the future republic of Peru . Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain . Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil . Peruvian occupation of Jaen , Tumbes , and Guayaquil In the south , Ecuador had de jure claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as Tumbes which lay between the Zarumilla and Tumbes rivers . In Ecuador 's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across , Ecuador had de jure claims to an area it called Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros . These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar in December 17 , 1819 , during the Congress of Angostura when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created . Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17 , 1821 , and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17 , 1821 , without any outside help from revolutionary armies . However , that same year , 1821 , Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes . Some Peruvian generals , without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia , had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia , feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire . On July 28 , 1821 , Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin and Tumbes and Jaen which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force , had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru , even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain . After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the Battle of Ayacucho dated December 9 , 1824 , there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the Inca Empire and to include Bolivia and Ecuador . One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian - born Jos\u00e9 de La Mar , who became one of Peru 's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia . Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade , then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen , Tumbes , and part of Mainas , declared war . President and General Jos\u00e9 de La Mar , who was born in Ecuador , believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru , personally , with a Peruvian force , invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28 , 1828 . The war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at Battle of Tarqui dated February 27 , 1829 , led by Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre , defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar . This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22 , 1829 , whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes , Jaen , and Maynas . Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia , the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them . However , what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe river or the Huancabamba river . According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil , Tumbez , and Ja\u00e9n ; despite this , Peru returned Guayaquil , but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n , alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements , since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador , Colombia , and Venezuela . The dissolution of Gran Colombia Map of the former Gran Colombia in 1824 ( named in its time as Colombia ) , the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region . Ecuador in 1832 The Central District of the Gran Colombia , known as Cundinamarca or New Granada ( modern Colombia ) with its capital in Bogota , did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia , with its capital in Quito , from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13 , 1830 . After Ecuador 's separation , the Department of Cauca voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota . President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20 , 1830 , since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830 . Moreover , the Cauca region throughout its long history had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador . Also , the Cauca region which included such cities as Pasto , Popay\u00e1n , and Buenaventura had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito . Fruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito , where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832 . In five months , New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen . Seeing that his officers were rebelling , mutinying , and changing sides , President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada . The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada ( modern Colombia ) , the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia ( Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia ) passed on June 25 , 1824 . This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river . Later , Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia , while reorganizing its government , unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River . Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin South America ( 1879 ) : All land claims by Peru , Ecuador , Colombia , Brazil , Argentina , Chile , and Bolivia in 1879 When Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia , Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made . Peru contested Ecuador 's claims with the newly discovered Real Cedula of 1802 , by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru . During colonial times this was to halt the ever - expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains , which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin . Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument , which had nothing to do with political borders . Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories , after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil . This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish - Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers . Peru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region which it began calling Loreto with its capital in Iquitos . During its negotiations with Brazil , Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802 , it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range , depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin . Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers . Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on - Amazon river . Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador . Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860 , since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders , but returned Guayaquil after a few months . The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910 , but to no avail . In the early part of the 20th century Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation . On May 6 , 1904 , Ecuador signed the Tobar - Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil 's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador 's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru 's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23 , 1851 . Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government 's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza - Suarez Treaty was signed July 15 , 1916 , in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador 's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers . In this way Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia , thus cutting itself off from Brazil . Later a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru , over Peru 's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region , which ended with the Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon - Lozano Treaty on March 24 , 1922 . Ecuador protested this secret treaty , since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916 . In July 21 , 1924 the Ponce - Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration . Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30 , 1935 . These negotiations were long and tiresome . Both sides logically presented their cases , but no one seemed to give up their claims . Then on February 6 , 1937 , Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day . The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29 , 1937 the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere . Four years later in 1941 , amid fast - growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River , war broke out with Peru . Peru claimed that Ecuador 's military presence in Peruvian - claimed territory was an invasion ; Ecuador , for its part , claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador 's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez , Jaen , and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers . In July 1941 , troops were mobilized in both countries . Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300 , of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces . Hostilities erupted on July 5 , 1941 , when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations , testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops . Finally , on July 23 , 1941 , the Peruvians launched a major invasion , crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of El Oro . Map of Ecuadorian Land Claims after 1916 During the course of the Ecuadorian -- Peruvian War , Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro , and some parts of the province of Loja , demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims . The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of Guayaquil , almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops . After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations , all fighting came to a stop . Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the Rio Protocol , signed on January 29 , 1942 , in favor of hemispheric unity against the Axis Powers in World War II favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end . The 1944 Glorious May Revolution followed a military - civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador 's government . However , a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s , while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon . In 1972 , construction of the Andean pipeline was completed . The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast , making Ecuador South America 's second largest oil exporter . The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru , however . Ecuadorian troops during the Cenepa War The Mirage F. 1JA ( FAE - 806 ) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian Sukhoi Su - 22 on February 10 , 1995 . The Rio Protocol failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor region in southern Ecuador . This caused a long - simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru , which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries ; first a border skirmish in January -- February 1981 known as the Paquisha Incident , and ultimately full - scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador . Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities , known as the Cenepa War . Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n , the Ecuadorian president , famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador . Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly nationalistic against Peru : graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the `` Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica '' , a reference to the murder of Abel by his brother Cain in the Book of Genesis . Ecuador and Peru signed the Brasilia Presidential Act peace agreement on October 26 , 1998 , which ended hostilities , and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere 's longest running territorial dispute . The Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ( Argentina , Brazil , Chile , and the United States of America ) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor . While Ecuador had to give up its decades - old territorial claims to the eastern slopes of the Cordillera , as well as to the entire western area of Cenepa headwaters , Peru was compelled to give to Ecuador , in perpetual lease but without sovereignty , 1 km ( 0.39 sq mi ) of its territory , in the area where the Ecuadorian base of Tiwinza -- focal point of the war -- had been located within Peruvian soil and which the Ecuadorian Army held during the conflict . The final border demarcation came into effect on May 13 , 1999 and the multi-national MOMEP ( Military Observer Mission for Ecuador and Peru ) troop deployment withdrew on June 17 , 1999 . Military governments ( 1972 -- 79 ) In 1972 , a `` revolutionary and nationalist '' military junta overthrew the government of Velasco Ibarra . The coup d'\u00e9tat was led by General Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G . The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to Argentina . He remained in power until 1976 , when he was removed by another military government . That military junta was led by Admiral Alfredo Poveda , who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council . The Supreme Council included two other members : General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco . The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections . Colonel Richelieu Levoyer , Government Minister , proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections . This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office . Return to Democracy Elections were held on April 29 , 1979 , under a new constitution . Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera was elected president , garnering over one million votes , the most in Ecuadorian history . He took office on August 10 , as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships . In 1980 , he founded the Partido Pueblo , Cambio y Democracia ( People , Change , and Democracy Party ) after withdrawing from the Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares ( Popular Forces Concentration ) and governed until May 24 , 1981 , when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense , Marco Subia Martinez , when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border . Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA , given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda , deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation , and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident . Roldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado , who was followed in 1984 by Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero from the Social Christian Party . Rodrigo Borja Cevallos of the Democratic Left ( Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica , or ID ) party won the presidency in 1988 , running in the runoff election against Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram ( brother in law of Jaime Roldos and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party ) . His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms , notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade . The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group , `` \u00a1 Alfaro Vive , Carajo ! '' ( `` Alfaro Lives , Dammit ! '' ) , named after Eloy Alfaro . However , continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID , and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999 . The emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years . The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform , lower unemployment and provision of social services , and historical exploitation by the land - holding elite . Their movement , along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements , has led to a deterioration of the executive office . The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital , as illustrated by the most recent removal of President Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez from office by Congress in April 2005 . Vice President Alfredo Palacio took his place and remained in office until the presidential election of 2006 , in which Rafael Correa gained the presidency . In December 2008 , president Correa declared Ecuador 's national debt illegitimate , based on the argument that it was odious debt contracted by corrupt and despotic prior regimes . He announced that the country would default on over $3 billion worth of bonds ; he then pledged to fight creditors in international courts and succeeded in reducing the price of outstanding bonds by more than 60 % . He brought Ecuador into the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas in June 2009 . To date , Correa 's administration has succeeded in reducing the high levels of poverty and unemployment in Ecuador . Government and politics Main article : Politics of Ecuador The former President Rafael Correa assumed office on January 15 , 2007 The Ecuadorian State consists of five branches of government : the Executive Branch , the Legislative Branch , the Judicial Branch , the Electoral Branch , and Transparency and Social Control . Ecuador is governed by a democratically elected President , for a four - year term . The current president of Ecuador , Lenin Moreno , exercises his power from the presidential Palacio de Carondelet in Quito . The current constitution was written by the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly elected in 2007 , and was approved by referendum in 2008 . Since 1936 , voting is compulsory for all literate persons aged 18 -- 65 , optional for all other citizens . The executive branch includes 23 ministries . Provincial governors and councilors ( mayors , aldermen , and parish boards ) are directly elected . The National Assembly of Ecuador meets throughout the year except for recesses in July and December . There are thirteen permanent committees . Members of the National Court of Justice are appointed by the National Judicial Council for nine - year terms . Executive branch Main article : List of heads of state of Ecuador Palacio de Carondelet , the executive branch of the Ecuadorian Government The executive branch is led by the president , an office currently held by Lenin Moreno . He is accompanied by the vice-president , currently Jorge Glas , elected for four years ( with the ability to be re-elected only once ) . As head of state and chief government official , he is responsible for public administration including the appointing of national coordinators , ministers , ministers of State and public servants . The executive branch defines foreign policy , appoints the Chancellor of the Republic , as well as ambassadors and consuls , being the ultimate authority over the Armed Forces of Ecuador , National Police of Ecuador , and appointing authorities . The acting president 's wife receives the title of First Lady of Ecuador . Legislative branch Main article : National Assembly ( Ecuador ) The legislative branch is embodied by the National Assembly , which is headquartered in the city of Quito in the Legislative Palace , and consists of 137 assemblymen , divided into ten committees and elected for a four - year term . Fifteen national constituency elected assembly , two Assembly members elected from each province and one for every 100,000 inhabitants or fraction exceeding 150,000 , according to the latest national population census . In addition , statute determines the election of assembly of regions , and metropolitan districts . Judicial branch Ecuador 's judiciary has as its main body the Judicial Council , and also includes the National Court of Justice , provincial courts , and lower courts . Legal representation is made by the Judicial Council . The National Court of Justice is composed of 21 judges elected for a term of nine years . Judges are renewed by thirds every three years pursuant to the Judicial Code . These are elected by the Judicial Council on the basis of opposition proceedings and merits . The justice system is buttressed by the independent offices of public prosecutor and the public defender . Auxiliary organs are as follows : notaries , court auctioneers , and court receivers . Also there is a special legal regime for Amerindians . Electoral branch The electoral system functions by authorities which enter only every four years or when elections or referendums occur . Its main functions are to organize , control elections , and punish the infringement of electoral rules . Its main body is the National Electoral Council , which is based in the city of Quito , and consists of seven members of the political parties most voted , enjoying complete financial and administrative autonomy . This body , along with the electoral court , forms the Electoral Branch which is one of Ecuador 's five branches of government . Transparency and Social control branch The Transparency and Social Control consists of the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control , an ombudsman , the Comptroller General of the State , and the superintendents . Branch members hold office for five years . This branch is responsible for promoting transparency and control plans publicly , as well as plans to design mechanisms to combat corruption , as also designate certain authorities , and be the regulatory mechanism of accountability in the country . Human rights UN 's Human Rights Council 's ( HRC ) Universal Periodic Review ( UPR ) has treated the restrictions on freedom of expression and efforts to control NGOs and recommended that Ecuador should stop the criminal sanctions for the expression of opinions , and delay in implementing judicial reforms . Ecuador rejected the recommendation on decriminalization of libel . According to Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) President Correa has intimidated journalists and subjected them to `` public denunciation and retaliatory litigation '' . The sentences to journalists have been years of imprisonment and millions of dollars of compensation , even though defendants have been pardoned . Correa has stated he was only seeking a retraction for slanderous statements . According to HRW , Correa 's government has weakened the freedom of press and independence of the judicial system . In Ecuador 's current judicial system , judges are selected in a contest of merits , rather than government appointments . However , the process of selection has been criticized as biased and subjective . In particular , the final interview is said to be given `` excessive weighing . '' Judges and prosecutors that have made decisions in favor of Correa in his lawsuits have received permanent posts , while others with better assessment grades have been rejected . Adult Gal\u00e1pagos sea lion resting on a park bench in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno . The laws also forbid articles and media messages that could favor or disfavor some political message or candidate . In the first half of 2012 , twenty private TV or radio stations were closed down . In July 2012 the officials warned the judges that they would be sanctioned and possibly dismissed if they allowed the citizens to appeal to the protection of their constitutional rights against the state . People engaging in public protests against environmental and other issues are prosecuted for `` terrorism and sabotage '' , which may lead to an eight - year prison sentence . Foreign Affairs Main article : Foreign relations of Ecuador Ecuador 's principal foreign policy objectives have traditionally included defense of its territory from external aggression and support for the objectives of the United Nations and the OAS . Ecuador 's membership in the OPEC in the 1970s and 1980s allowed Ecuadorian leaders to exercise somewhat greater foreign policy autonomy . In Antarctica , Ecuador has maintained a peaceful research station for scientific study as a member nation of the Antarctica Treaty . Ecuador has often placed great emphasis on multilateral approaches to international issues . Ecuador is a member of the United Nations ( and most of its specialized agencies ) and a member of many regional groups , including the Rio Group , the Latin American Economic System , the Latin American Energy Organization , the Latin American Integration Association , the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America , the Andean Community of Nations , the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) , and The Bank of the South ( Spanish : Banco del Sur or BancoSur ) . Administrative divisions Main articles : Provinces of Ecuador and Cantons of Ecuador Ecuador is divided into 24 provinces ( Spanish : provincias ) , each with its own administrative capital : Map of Ecuador Extent of Ecuador 's western EEZ in the Pacific Administrative divisions of Ecuador Province Surface ( km2 ) Population ( 2010 ) Capital Azuay 8,639 702,893 Cuenca Bol\u00edvar 3,254 182,744 Guaranda Ca\u00f1ar 3,908 223,463 Azogues Carchi 3,699 165,659 Tulc\u00e1n 5 Chimborazo 5,287 452,352 Riobamba 6 Cotopaxi 6,569 406,798 Latacunga 7 El Oro 5,988 588,546 Machala 8 Esmeraldas 15,216 520,711 Esmeraldas 9 Gal\u00e1pagos 8,010 22,770 Puerto Baquerizo Moreno 10 Guayas 17,139 3,573,003 Guayaquil 11 Imbabura 4,599 400,359 Ibarra 12 Loja 11,027 446,743 Loja 13 Los R\u00edos 6,254 765,274 Babahoyo 14 Manab\u00ed 18,400 1,345,779 Portoviejo 15 Morona - Santiago 25,690 147,886 Macas 16 Napo 13,271 104,047 Tena 17 Orellana 20,773 137,848 Puerto Francisco de Orellana 18 Pastaza 29,520 84,329 Puyo 19 Pichincha 9,494 2,570,201 Quito 20 Santa Elena 3,763 301,168 Santa Elena 21 Santo Domingo de los Ts\u00e1chilas 3,857 365,965 Santo Domingo 22 Sucumb\u00edos 18,612 174,522 Nueva Loja 23 Tungurahua 3,334 500,775 Ambato 24 Zamora - Chinchipe 10,556 91,219 Zamora The provinces are divided into cantons and further subdivided into parishes ( parroquias ) . Regions and Planning areas Regionalization , or zoning , is the union of two or more adjoining provinces in order to decentralize the administrative functions of the capital Quito . In Ecuador there are seven regions or zones , each shaped by the following provinces : Region 1 ( 42,126 km2 , or 16,265 mi2 ) : Esmeraldas , Carchi , Imbabura , and Sucumbios . Administrative city : Ibarra Region 2 ( 43,498 km2 , or 16,795 mi2 ) : Pichincha , Napo , and Orellana . Administrative city : Tena Region 3 ( 44,710 km2 , or 17,263 mi2 ) : Chimborazo , Tungurahua , Pastaza , and Cotopaxi . Administrative city : Riobamba Region 4 ( 22,257 km2 , or 8,594 mi2 ) : Manab\u00ed and Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas . Administrative city : Ciudad Alfaro Region 5 ( 38,420 km2 , or 14,834 mi2 ) : Santa Elena , Guayas , Los R\u00edos , Gal\u00e1pagos , and Bol\u00edvar . Administrative city : Milagro Region 6 ( 38,237 km2 , or 14,763 mi2 ) : Ca\u00f1ar , Azuay , and Morona Santiago . Administrative city : Cuenca Region 7 ( 27,571 km2 , or 10,645 mi2 ) : El Oro , Loja , and Zamora Chinchipe . Administrative city : Loja Quito and Guayaquil are Metropolitan Districts . Gal\u00e1pagos , despite being included within Region 5 , is also under a special unit . Military Main article : Military of Ecuador A Puma helicopter from the Army 's Aviation Branch Ecuadorian Air Force ( FAE ) BAE Shyri ( SS - 101 ) ( es ) from the Ecuadorian Navy . The Ecuadorian Armed Forces ( Fuerzas Armadas del Ecuador ) , consists of the Army , Air Force , and Navy and have the stated responsibility for the preservation of the integrity and national sovereignty of the national territory . The military tradition starts in Gran Colombia , where a sizable army was stationed in Ecuador due to border disputes with Peru , which claimed territories under its political control when it was a Spanish vice-royalty . Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in 1830 , Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force . So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General Juan Jose Flores , first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin . General Jose Ma . Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period . Due to the continuous border disputes with Peru , finally settled in the early 2000s , and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces , the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes . In 2009 , the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces , increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803 , an increase of 25 % . The icons of the Ecuadorian military forces are the Marshall Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and General Eloy Alfaro . The Military Academy General Eloy Alfaro ( c. 1838 ) graduates the army officers and is located in Quito . The Ecuadorian Navy Academy ( c. 1837 ) , located in Salinas graduates the navy officers , and the Air Academy `` Cosme Rennella ( c. 1920 ) , also located in Salinas , graduates the air force officers . Other training academies for different military specialties are found across the country . Geography Main article : Geography of Ecuador Ecuador topography A view of the Cotopaxi volcano , in Cotopaxi Province birds in the Yasuni National Park Ecuador has a total area of 283,561 km ( 109,484 sq mi ) , including the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands . Of this , 276,841 km ( 106,889 sq mi ) is land and 6,720 km ( 2,595 sq mi ) water . Ecuador is bigger than Uruguay , Suriname , Guyana and French Guyana in South America . Ecuador lies between latitudes 2 \u00b0 N and 5 \u00b0 S , bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean , and has 2,337 km ( 1,452 mi ) of coastline . It has 2,010 km ( 1,250 mi ) of land boundaries , with Colombia in the north 590 km ( 367 mi ) border and Peru in the east and south 1,420 km ( 882 mi ) border . It is the westernmost country that lies on the equator . The country has four main geographic regions : La Costa , or `` the coast '' : The coastal region consists of the provinces to the West of the Andean range -- Esmeraldas , Guayas , Los R\u00edos , Manab\u00ed , El Oro , Santa Elena . It is the country 's most fertile and productive land , and is the seat of the large banana exportation plantations of the companies Dole and Chiquita . This region is also where most of Ecuador 's rice crop is grown . The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries . The largest coastal city is Guayaquil . La Sierra , or `` the highlands '' : The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces -- Azuay , Ca\u00f1ar , Carchi , Chimborazo , Imbabura , Loja , Pichincha , and Tungurahua . This land contains most of Ecuador 's volcanoes and all of its snow - capped peaks . Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of potato , maize , and quinua and the population is predominantly Amerindian Kichua . The largest Sierran city is Quito . La Amazon\u00eda , also known as El Oriente , or `` the east '' : The oriente consists of the Amazon jungle provinces -- Morona Santiago , Napo , Orellana , Pastaza , Sucumb\u00edos , and Zamora - Chinchipe . This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones , which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally . It is also the area with the largest reserves of petroleum in Ecuador , and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies . The population is primarily mixed Amerindian Shuar , Huaorani and Kichua , although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little - contacted . The largest city in the Oriente is probably Lago Agrio in Sucumb\u00edos , although Macas in Morona Santiago runs a close second . La Regi\u00f3n Insular is the region comprising the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands , some 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean . Ecuador 's capital is Quito , which is in the province of Pichincha in the Sierra region . Its largest city is Guayaquil , in the Guayas Province . Cotopaxi , just south of Quito , is one of the world 's highest active volcanoes . The top of Mount Chimborazo ( 6,268 m , or 20,560 ft , above sea level ) , Ecuador 's tallest mountain , is the most distant point from the center of the Earth on the Earth 's surface because of the ellipsoid shape of the planet . Climate Main article : Climate of Ecuador Ecuador map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification . There is great variety in the climate , largely determined by altitude . It is mild year - round in the mountain valleys , with a humid subtropical climate in coastal areas and rainforest in lowlands . The Pacific coastal area has a tropical climate with a severe rainy season . The climate in the Andean highlands is temperate and relatively dry , and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones . Because of its location at the equator , Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year . Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours . Hydrology Main article : Rivers of Ecuador Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa is an important tourist site The Andes is the watershed divisor between the Amazon watershed , which runs to the east , and the Pacific , including the north -- south rivers Mataje , Santiago , Esmeraldas , Chone , Guayas , Jubones , and Puyango - Tumbes . Almost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the La Sierra region and flow east toward the Amazon River or west toward the Pacific Ocean . The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations . In the La Sierra region , the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes . Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the Andes to the lower elevations of the other regions . The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente . A beach of Salinas , Santa Elena Province In the Costa , the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season . The few exceptions are the longer , perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the Pacific Ocean . The internal coast , by contrast , is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season , sometimes forming swamps . Major rivers in the Oriente include the Pastaza , Napo , and Putumayo . The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers , both of which rise in the Sierra . The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall , which at sixty - one meters ( 200 feet ) is the highest waterfall in Ecuador . The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands . The Napo ranges in width from 500 to 1,800 m ( 1,600 to 5,900 ft ) . In its upper reaches , the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries , the Coca River , where it slows and levels off . The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia . All of these rivers flow into the Amazon River . The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers . Several of the larger islands , however , have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean . Biodiversity Ecuador is one of the most megadiverse countries in the world , it also has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation , and is one of the highest endemism worldwide . In the image the Spectacled bear of the Andes . Ecuador is one of seventeen megadiverse countries in the world according to Conservation International , and it has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation . Ecuador has 1,600 bird species ( 15 % of the world 's known bird species ) in the continental area and 38 more endemic in the Gal\u00e1pagos . In addition to over 16,000 species of plants , the country has 106 endemic reptiles , 138 endemic amphibians , and 6,000 species of butterfly . The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are well known as a region of distinct fauna , famous as the place of birth of Darwin 's Theory of Evolution and a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Ecuador has the first constitution to recognize the rights of nature . The protection of the nation 's biodiversity is an explicit national priority as stated in the National Plan of `` Buen Vivir '' , or good living , Objective 4 , `` Guarantee the rights of nature '' , Policy 1 : `` Sustainably conserve and manage the natural heritage , including its land and marine biodiversity , which is considered a strategic sector '' . As of the writing of the Plan in 2008 , 19 % of Ecuador 's land area was in a protected area ; however , the Plan also states that 32 % of the land must be protected in order to truly preserve the nation 's biodiversity . Current protected areas include 11 national parks , 10 wildlife refuges , 9 ecological reserves , and other areas . A program begun in 2008 , Sociobosque , is preserving another 2.3 % of total land area ( 6,295 km2 , or 629,500 ha ) by paying private landowners or community landowners ( such as Amerindian tribes ) incentives to maintain their land as native ecosystems such as native forests or grasslands . Eligibility and subsidy rates for this program are determined based on the poverty in the region , the number of hectares that will be protected , and the type of ecosystem of the land to be protected , among other factors . Despite being on the UNESCO list , the Gal\u00e1pagos are endangered by a range of negative environmental effects , threatening the existence of this exotic ecosystem . Additionally , oil exploitation of the Amazon rainforest has led to the release of billions of gallons of untreated wastes , gas , and crude oil into the environment , contaminating ecosystems and causing detrimental health effects to Amerindian peoples . Economy Main article : Economy of Ecuador Tree map of products exported by Ecuador in the HS4 product classification . Ecuador has a developing economy that is highly dependent on commodities , namely petroleum and agricultural products . The country is classified as an upper - middle - income country . Ecuador 's economy is the eighth largest in Latin America and experienced an average growth of 4.6 % between 2000 and 2006 . From 2007 to 2012 Ecuador 's GDP grew at an annual average of 4.3 percent , above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean , which was 3.5 % , according to the United Nations ' Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) . Ecuador was able to maintain relatively superior growth during the crisis . In January 2009 the Central Bank of Ecuador ( BCE ) put the 2010 growth forecast at 6.88 % . In 2011 its GDP grew at 8 % and ranked 3rd highest in Latin America , behind Argentina ( 2nd ) and Panama ( 1st ) . Between 1999 and 2007 , GDP doubled , reaching $65,490 million according to BCE . Inflation rate up to January 2008 was located about 1.14 % , the highest recorded in the last year , according to the government . The monthly unemployment rate remained at about 6 and 8 percent from December 2007 until September 2008 ; however , it went up to about 9 percent in October and dropped again in November 2008 to 8 percent . Unemployment mean annual rate for 2009 in Ecuador was 8.5 % because the global economic crisis continued to affect the Latin American economies . From this point unemployment rates started a downward trend : 7.6 % in 2010 , 6.0 % in 2011 , and 4.8 % in 2012 . The extreme poverty rate has declined significantly between 1999 and 2010 . In 2001 it was estimated at 40 % of the population , while by 2011 the figure dropped to 17.4 % of the total population . This is explained to an extent by emigration and the economic stability achieved after adopting the U.S. dollar as official means of transaction . However , starting in 2008 with the bad economic performance of the nations where most Ecuadorian emigrants work , the reduction of poverty has been realized through social spending mainly in education and health . The United States dollar is the common currency circulation in Ecuador . Oil accounts for 40 % of exports and contributes to maintaining a positive trade balance . Since the late 1960s , the exploitation of oil increased production , and proven reserves are estimated at 6.51 billion barrels as of 2011 . The overall trade balance for August 2012 was a surplus of almost $390 million for the first six months of 2012 , a huge figure compared with that of 2007 , which reached only $5.7 million ; the surplus had risen by about $425 million compared to 2006 . The oil trade balance positive had revenues of $3.295 million in 2008 , while non-oil was negative , amounting to $2.842 million . The trade balance with the United States , Chile , the European Union , Bolivia , Peru , Brazil , and Mexico is positive . The trade balance with Argentina , Colombia , and Asia is negative . In the agricultural sector , Ecuador is a major exporter of bananas ( first place worldwide in production and export ) , flowers , and the seventh largest producer of cocoa . Ecuador also produces coffee , rice , potatoes , cassava ( manioc , tapioca ) , plantains and sugarcane ; cattle , sheep , pigs , beef , pork and dairy products ; fish , and shrimp ; and balsa wood . The country 's vast resources include large amounts of timber across the country , like eucalyptus and mangroves . Pines and cedars are planted in the region of La Sierra and walnuts , rosemary , and balsa wood in the Guayas River Basin . The industry is concentrated mainly in Guayaquil , the largest industrial center , and in Quito , where in recent years the industry has grown considerably . This city is also the largest business center of the country . Industrial production is directed primarily to the domestic market . Despite this , there is limited export of products produced or processed industrially . These include canned foods , liquor , jewelry , furniture , and more . A minor industrial activity is also concentrated in Cuenca . The incomes due to the tourism have been increasing during the last years because of the efforts of the Government of showing the variety of climates and the biodiversity in Ecuador . World Trade Center headquarters in Guayaquil Ecuador has negotiated bilateral treaties with other countries , besides belonging to the Andean Community of Nations , and an associate member of Mercosur . It also serves on the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , in addition to the Inter-American Development Bank ( IDB ) , World Bank , International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , Corporaci\u00f3n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) and other multilateral agencies . In April 2007 , Ecuador paid off its debt to the IMF , thus ending an era of interventionism of the Agency in the country . The public finance of Ecuador consists of the Central Bank of Ecuador ( BCE ) , the National Development Bank ( BNF ) , the State Bank . Tourism Main article : Tourism in Ecuador The historic center of Quito has one of the largest and best - preserved historic centers in the Americas . The city also houses a large number of museums . The Ministry of Information and Tourism was created on August 10 , 1992 , at the beginning of the government of Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n , who viewed tourism as a fundamental activity for the economic and social development of the peoples . Faced with the growth of the tourism sector , in June 1994 , the decision was taken to separate tourism from information , so that it is exclusively dedicated to promoting and strengthening this activity . Ecuador is a country with vast natural wealth . The diversity of its four regions has given rise to thousands of species of flora and fauna . It has around 1640 kinds of birds . The species of butterflies border the 4,500 , the reptiles 345 , the amphibians 358 and the mammals 258 , among others . Not in vain , Ecuador is considered one of the 17 countries where the planet 's highest biodiversity is concentrated , being also the largest country with diversity per km2 in the world . Most of its fauna and flora lives in 26 protected areas by the State . Also , it has a huge culture spectrum . Since 2007 , with the government of Rafael Correa , the tourism brand `` Ecuador Ama la Vida '' has been transformed , with which the nation 's tourism promotion would be sold . Focused on considering it as a country friendly and respectful of the nature , natural biodiversity and cultural diversity of the peoples . And for this , means of exploiting them are developed along with the private economy . The country has two cities UNESCO World Heritage Sites : Quito and Cuenca , as well as two natural UNESCO World Heritage Sites : the Galapagos Islands and Sangay National Park in addition to one World Biosphere Reserve , such as the Cajas massif . Culturally , the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized . The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country . Among the main tourist destinations are : Nature attractions : Galapagos Islands , Yasuni National Park , El Cajas National Park , Sangay National Park , Podocarpus National Park , Vilcabamba , Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa . Cultural attractions : Historic center of Quito , Ciudad Mitad del Mundo , Ingapirca , Historic center of Cuenca , Latacunga and its Mama Negra festival . Snowy mountains : Antisana volcano , Cayambe volcano , Chimborazo volcano , Cotopaxi volcano , Illinizas volcanoes . Beaches : Crucita , Atacames , Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez , Esmeraldas , Manta , Salinas , Monta\u00f1ita Transport The Troleb\u00fas bus rapid transit system that runs through Quito . It is the principal BRT in Ecuador . Railways in Ecuador ( interactive map ) Main article : Transport in Ecuador The rehabilitation and reopening of the Ecuadorian railroad and use of it as a tourist attraction is one of the recent developments in transportation matters . The roads of Ecuador in recent years have undergone important improvement . The major routes are Pan American ( under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato , the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja ) . In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru , there are the Route Espondilus and \/ or Ruta del Sol ( oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline ) and the Amazon backbone ( which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon , linking most and more major cities of it ) . Another major project is developing the road Manta -- Tena , the highway Guayaquil -- Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo , Riobamba -- Macas ( which crosses Sangay National Park ) . Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil , the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana , the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name , and , perhaps the most remarkable of all , the Bahia -- San Vincente Bridge , being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast . The Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito and the Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport in Guayaquil have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization . In the case of Guayaquil it involved a new air terminal , once considered the best in South America and the best in Latin America and in Quito where an entire new airport has been built in Tababela and was inaugurated in February 2013 , with Canadian assistance . However , the main road leading from Quito city centre to the new airport will only be finished in late 2014 , making current travelling from the airport to downtown Quito as long as two hours during rush hour . Quito 's old city - centre airport is being turned into parkland , with some light industrial use . Electrical power outlets Electrical power outlets in Ecuador are the same as in the US ( 110v ) . Mobile ( cellular ) phone frequencies Mobile ( cellular ) phone frequencies in Ecuador are 850 MHz , 1900 MHz , and 1700 \/ 2100 MHz ( LTE ) .

Portrait of a noble lady with her black slave by Vicente Alb\u00e1n . Painting of 1783 . Quito Painting Colonial School . Ecuador 's population is ethnically diverse and the 2016 estimates put Ecuador 's population at 16,385,068 . The largest ethnic group ( as of 2010 ) is the Mestizos , who are the descendants of Spanish colonists that interbred with Amerindian peoples , and constitute about 71 % of the population . The White Ecuadorians ( White Latin American ) account for 6.1 % of the population of Ecuador and can be found throughout all of Ecuador primarily around the urban areas . Even though Ecuador 's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain , today Ecuador 's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants , predominantly from Spain with people from Italy , France , Germany , and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century . Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority . These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent , who are either Christian or Muslim ( Islam in Ecuador ) . In addition , there is a small European Jewish ( Ecuadorian Jews ) population , which is based mainly in Quito and to a lesser extent in Guayaquil . Amerindians account for 7 % of the current population . The mostly rural Montubio population of the coastal provinces of Ecuador , who might be classified as Pardo account for 7.4 % of the population . The Afro - Ecuadorians is a minority population ( 7 % ) in Ecuador , that includes the Mulattos and zambos , and are largely based in the Esmeraldas province and to a lesser degree in the predominantly Mestizo provinces of Coastal Ecuador - Guayas and Manabi . In the Highland Andes where a predominantly Mestizo , white and Amerindian population exist , the African presence is almost non-existent except for a small community in the province of Imbabura called Chota Valley . Religion Main article : Religion in Ecuador Iglesia de San Sebasti\u00e1n church in Cuenca Religion in Ecuador Religion percent Roman Catholic 74 % Protestant 10.4 % Atheist 7.9 % Other 6.4 % Jehovah 's Witness 1.2 % Black 1 % Agnostic 0.1 % Other 0.4 % According to the Ecuadorian National Institute of Statistics and Census , 91.95 % of the country 's population have a religion , 7.94 % are atheists and 0.11 % are agnostics . Among the people that have a religion , 80.44 % are Roman Catholic Latin Rite ( see List of Roman Catholic dioceses in Ecuador ) , 11.30 % are Evangelical Protestants , 1.29 % are Jehovah 's Witnesses and 6.97 % other ( mainly Jewish , Buddhists and Latter - day Saints ) . Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco in Quito In the rural parts of Ecuador , Amerindian beliefs and Catholicism are sometimes syncretized . Most festivals and annual parades are based on religious celebrations , many incorporating a mixture of rites and icons . There is a small number of Eastern Orthodox Christians , Amerindian religions , Muslims ( see Islam in Ecuador ) , Buddhists and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed . According to their own estimates , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints accounts for about 1.4 % of the population , or 211,165 members at the end of 2012 . According to their own sources , in 2017 there were 92,752 Jehovah 's Witnesses in the country . The first Jews arrived in Ecuador in the 16th and 17th centuries . Most of them are Sephardic Anusim ( Crypto - Jews ) and many still speak Judaeo - Spanish ( Ladino ) language . Today the Jewish Community of Ecuador ( Comunidad Jud\u00eda del Ecuador ) has its seat in Quito and has approximately 200 members . Nevertheless , this number is declining because young people leave the country for the United States or Israel . The Community has a Jewish Center with a synagogue , a country club , and a cemetery . It supports the `` Albert Einstein School '' , where Jewish history , religion , and Hebrew classes are offered . There are very small communities in Cuenca . The `` Comunidad de Culto Israelita '' reunites the Jews of Guayaquil . This community works independently from the `` Jewish Community of Ecuador '' and is composed of only 30 people . Nations Main article : Indigenous peoples in Ecuador Ethnic groups in Ecuador Ethnic group percent Mestizo ( mixed Amerindian and White ) 71.9 % Montubio 7.4 % Amerindian 7 % White 6.1 % Afro Ecuadorian 4.3 % Mulato 1.9 % Black 1 % Other 0.4 % The Ecuadorian constitution recognizes the `` pluri - nationality '' of those who want to exercise their affiliation with their native ethnic groups . Thus , in addition to criollos , mestizos , and Afro - Ecuadorians , some people belong to the Amerindian nations scattered in a few places in the coast , Quechua Andean villages , and the Amazonian jungle . Population genetics According to a 2015 genealogical DNA testing , the average Ecuadorian is estimated to be 52.96 % Native American , 41.77 % European , and 5.26 % Sub-Saharan African overall . Population density The majority of Ecuadorians live in the central provinces , the Andes mountains , or along the Pacific coast . The tropical forest region to the east of the mountains ( El Oriente ) remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3 % of the population . Birth rate is 2 - 1 for each death . Marriages are usually from 14 and above using parental consent . About 12.4 % of the population is married in the ages 15 -- 19 . Divorce rates are moderate .

You can help by adding to it . ( August 2012 ) See also : Emigration from Ecuador A small east Asian Latino community , estimated at 2,500 , mainly consists of those of Japanese and Chinese descent , whose ancestors arrived as miners , farmhands and fishermen in the late 19th century . In the early years of World War II , Ecuador still admitted a certain number of immigrants , and in 1939 , when several South American countries refused to accept 165 Jewish refugees from Germany aboard the ship Koenigstein , Ecuador granted them entry permits . In recent years , Ecuador has grown in popularity among North American expatriates . They 're drawn there by the authentic cultural experience and beautiful natural surroundings . Also , Ecuador 's favorable residency options make for an easy transition for those who decide to settle there indefinitely . Another perk that draws many expats to Ecuador is its low cost of living . Since everything from gas to groceries costs far less than in North America , it 's a popular choice for those who are looking to make the most of their retirement budget . Even real estate in Ecuador is much less than its tropical counterparts . However , as more and more North Americans are discovering Ecuador 's potential , property prices are beginning to rise from where they were a decade ago , particularly in the areas that are popular among expats and tourists . Culture Main article : Culture of Ecuador Ca\u00f1ari children with the typical Andean indigenous clothes Ecuador 's mainstream culture is defined by its Hispanic mestizo majority , and , like their ancestry , it is traditionally of Spanish heritage , influenced in different degrees by Amerindian traditions and in some cases by African elements . The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists , following the arrival of Europeans in 1499 . A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and , in smaller numbers , Poles , Lithuanians , English , Irish , and Croats during and after the Second World War . Huaorani man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes Since African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains , given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and encomiendas , the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas . This is largely owing to the 17th - century shipwreck of a slave - trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador . The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then - thick jungle under the leadership of Anton , the chief of the group , where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture , not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region . A little later , freed slaves from Colombia known as cimarrones joined them . In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province 's predominantly mestizo population . These blacks are descendants of Africans , who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves . As a general rule , small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja , Zaruma , and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil . Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja . Ecuador 's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees , but some may also practice their own native cultures , particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the Amazon basin . Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90 % of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98 % . Part of Ecuador 's population can speak Amerindian languages , in some cases as a second language . Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages . Language Main article : Languages of Ecuador Languages in Ecuador Language percent Spanish ( Castilian ) 93 % Quechua 4.1 % Foreign 2.2 % Other Indigenous 0.7 % Most Ecuadorians speak Spanish , though many speak Amerindian language , such as Kichwa ( also spelt Quichua ) , which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador , Bolivia , Colombia , and Peru . Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit ( spoken by the Aw\u00e1 ) , A'ingae ( spoken by the Cofan ) , Shuar Chicham ( spoken by the Shuar ) , Achuar - Shiwiar ( spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar ) , Cha'palaachi ( spoken by the Chachi ) , Tsa'fiki ( spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila ) , Paicoca ( spoken by the Siona and Secoya ) , and Wao Tededeo ( spoken by the Waorani ) . Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are those universal to the Spanish - speaking world , there are several idiosyncrasies . Music Main article : Music of Ecuador Julio Jaramillo is an icon of the old Bolero music genre . The music of Ecuador has a long history . Pasillo is a genre of indigenous Latin music . In Ecuador it is the `` national genre of music '' . Through the years , many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music . There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo , pasacalle , fox incaico , tonada , capishca , Bomba ( highly established in Afro - Ecuadorian societies ) , and so on . Tecnocumbia and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures . One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is Sanjuanito . It 's originally from northern Ecuador ( Otavalo - Imbabura ) . Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities . According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno , Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista 's birthday . This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24 , coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of Inti Raymi . Cuisine See also : List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods Ceviche ecuatoriano ( Ecuadorian - style ceviche ) and Cuy asado ( grilled guinea pig ) are some of the typical dishes . Ecuadorian cuisine is diverse , varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions . Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three course meal of soup , a course that includes rice and a protein , and then dessert and coffee to finish . Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread . In the highland region , pork , chicken , beef , and cuy ( guinea pig ) are popular and are served with a variety of grains ( especially rice and corn ) or potatoes . In the coastal region , seafood is very popular , with fish , shrimp , and ceviche being key parts of the diet . Generally , ceviches are served with fried plantain ( chifles y patacones ) , popcorn , or tostado . Plantain - and peanut - based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals . Encocados ( dishes that contain a coconut sauce ) are also very popular . Churrasco is a staple food of the coastal region , especially Guayaquil . Arroz con menestra y carne asada ( rice with beans and grilled beef ) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil , as is fried plantain , which is often served with it . This region is a leading producer of bananas , Cocoa beans ( to make chocolate ) , shrimp , tilapia , mango , and passion fruit , among other products . In the Amazon region , a dietary staple is the yuca , elsewhere called cassava . Many fruits are available in this region , including bananas , tree grapes , and peach palms . Centro de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo , Quito Centro Cultural Metropolitano in the historic center of Quito Literature Early literature in colonial Ecuador , as in the rest of Spanish America , was influenced by the Spanish Golden Age . One of the earliest examples is Jacinto Collahuazo , an Amerindian chief of a northern village in today 's Ibarra , born in the late 1600s . Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish , Collahuazo learned to read and write in Castilian , but his work was written in Quechua . The use of Quipu was banned by the Spanish , and in order to preserve their work , many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language . The history behind the Inca drama `` Ollantay '' , the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America , shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo . Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned . The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later , when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript . The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the `` Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa '' , a poem written by Collahuazo , which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa . Other early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits Juan Bautista Aguirre , born in Daule in 1725 , and Father Juan de Velasco , born in Riobamba in 1727 . De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the Kingdom of Quito ( today Ecuador ) before the arrival of the Spanish . His historical accounts are nationalistic , featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history . Juan Montalvo Famous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include Eugenio Espejo , a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times ; Jose Joaquin de Olmedo ( born in Guayaquil ) , famous for his ode to Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar titled Victoria de Junin ; Juan Montalvo , a prominent essayist and novelist ; Juan Leon Mera , famous for his work `` Cumanda '' or `` Tragedy among Savages '' and the Ecuadorian National Anthem ; Juan A. Martinez with A la Costa ' ; , Dolores Veintimilla ; and others . Contemporary Ecuadorian writers include the novelist Jorge Enrique Adoum ; the poet Jorge Carrera Andrade ; the essayist Benjam\u00edn Carri\u00f3n ; the poets Medardo Angel Silva , Jorge Carrera Andrade , and Luis Alberto Costales ; the novelist Enrique Gil Gilbert ; the novelist Jorge Icaza ( author of the novel Huasipungo , translated to many languages ) ; the short story author Pablo Palacio ; and the novelist Alicia Yanez Cossio . In spite of Ecuador 's considerable mystique , it is rarely featured as a setting in contemporary western literature . One exception is `` The Ecuadorian Deception , '' a murder mystery \/ thriller authored by American Bear Mills . In it , George d'Hout , a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil . A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot , believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor . The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century . Art The best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the Escuela Quite\u00f1a ( Quito School ) , which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries , examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito . Ecuadorian painters include Eduardo Kingman , Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn , and Camilo Egas from the Indiginist Movement ; Manuel Rendon , Jaime Zapata , Enrique T\u00e1bara , An\u00edbal Villac\u00eds , Theo Constant\u00e9 , Luis Molinari , Araceli Gilbert , Judith Gutierrez , Felix Arauz , and Estuardo Maldonado from the Informalist Movement ; Teddy Cobe\u00f1a from expressionism and figurative style and Luis Burgos Flor with his abstract , futuristic style . The Amerindian people of Tigua , Ecuador , are also world - renowned for their traditional paintings . Sports Main article : Sport in Ecuador Jefferson P\u00e9rez , Olympic gold medalist Estadio Monumental Isidro Romero Carbo of Guayaquil . The most popular sport in Ecuador , as in most South American countries , is football . Its best known professional teams include Liga De Quito from Quito ; Emelec from Guayaquil ; Deportivo Quito , and El Nacional from Quito ; Olmedo from Riobamba ; and Deportivo Cuenca from Cuenca . Currently the most successful football team in Ecuador is LDU Quito , and it is the only Ecuadorian team that has won the Copa Libertadores , the Copa Sudamericana , and the Recopa Sudamericana ; they were also runners - up in the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup . The matches of the Ecuadorian national team are the most - watched sporting events in the country . Ecuador has qualified for the final rounds of the 2002 , the 2006 , & the 2014 FIFA World Cups . The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was considered a huge success for the country and its inhabitants . The unusually high elevation of the home stadium in Quito often affects the performance of visiting teams . Ecuador finished in 2nd place in the CONMEBOL qualifiers behind Argentina and above the team that would become World Champions , Brazil . In the 2006 FIFA World Cup , Ecuador finished ahead of Poland and Costa Rica finishing second behind Germany in Group A in the 2006 World Cup . They were defeated by England in the second round . Ecuador has won only two medals in the Olympic Games , both gained by 20 - km ( 12 mi ) racewalker Jefferson P\u00e9rez , who took gold in the 1996 games and silver 12 years later . P\u00e9rez also set a world best in the 2003 World Championships of 1 : 17 : 21 for the 20 - km ( 12 mi ) distance . Health Main article : Health in Ecuador IESS Hospital in Latacunga The current structure of the Ecuadorian public health care system dates back to 1967 . The Ministry of the Public Health ( Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica del Ecuador ) is the responsible entity of the regulation and creation of the public health policies and health care plans . The Minister of Public Health is appointed directly by the President of the Republic . The current minister , or Ecuadorian general surgeon , is Margarita Guevara . The philosophy of the Ministry of Public Health is the social support and service to the most vulnerable population , and its main plan of action lies around communitarian health and preventive medicine . The public healthcare system allows patients to be treated without an appointment in public general hospitals by general practitioners and specialists in the outpatient clinic ( Consulta Externa ) at no cost . This is done in the four basic specialties of pediatric , gynecology , clinic medicine , and surgery . There are also public hospitals specialized to treat chronic diseases , target a particular group of the population , or provide better treatment in some medical specialties . Some examples in this group are the Gynecologic Hospitals , or Maternities , Children Hospitals , Geriatric Hospitals , and Oncology Institutes . Although well - equipped general hospitals are found in the major cities or capitals of provinces , there are basic hospitals in the smaller towns and canton cities for family care consultation and treatments in pediatrics , gynecology , clinical medicine , and surgery . Community health care centers ( Centros de Salud ) are found inside metropolitan areas of cities and in rural areas . These are day hospitals that provide treatment to patients whose hospitalization is under 24 hours . The doctors assigned to rural communities , where the Amerindian population can be substantial , have small clinics under their responsibility for the treatment of patients in the same fashion as the day hospitals in the major cities . The treatment in this case respects the culture of the community . The public healthcare system should not be confused with the Ecuadorian Social Security healthcare service , which is dedicated to individuals with formal employment and who are affiliated obligatorily through their employers . Citizens with no formal employment may still contribute to the social security system voluntarily and have access to the medical services rendered by the social security system . The Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security ( IESS ) has several major hospitals and medical sub-centers under its administration across the nation . Ecuador currently ranks 20 , in most efficient health care countries , compared to 111 back in the year 2000 . Ecuadorians have a life expectancy of 75.6 years . The infant mortality rate is 13 per 1,000 live births , a major improvement from approximately 76 in the early 1980s and 140 in 1950 . 23 % of children under five are chronically malnourished . Population in some rural areas have no access to potable water , and its supply is provided by mean of water tankers . There are 686 malaria cases per 100,000 people . Basic health care , including doctor 's visits , basic surgeries , and basic medications , has been provided free since 2008 . However , some public hospitals are in poor condition and often lack necessary supplies to attend the high demand of patients . Private hospitals and clinics are well equipped but still expensive for the majority of the population . Education Rectorate building of the Higher Polytechnic School of the Litoral of Guayaquil Main article : Education in Ecuador The Oldest Observatory in South America is the Quito Astronomical Observatory , founded in 1873 and located in Quito , Ecuador . The Quito Astronomical Observatory is managed by National Polytechnic School . The Ecuadorian Constitution requires that all children attend school until they achieve a `` basic level of education '' , which is estimated at nine school years . In 1996 , the net primary enrollment rate was 96.9 % , and 71.8 % of children stayed in school until the fifth grade . The cost of primary and secondary education is borne by the government , but families often face significant additional expenses such as fees and transportation costs . Provision of public schools falls far below the levels needed , and class sizes are often very large , and families of limited means often find it necessary to pay for education . In rural areas , only 10 % of the children go on to high school . The Ministry of Education states that the mean number of years completed is 6.7 . Maldonado High School of Riobamba Ecuador has 61 universities , many of which still confer terminal degrees according to the traditional Spanish education system , honoring a long tradition of having some of the oldest universities in the Americas : University of San Fulgencio , founded in 1586 by the Augustines ; San Gregorio Magno University , founded in 1651 by the Jesuits ; and University of Santo Tom\u00e1s of Aquino , founded in 1681 by the Dominican order . Among the traditional conferred terminal degrees can be noted the doctorate for medicine and law schools or engineering , physics , chemistry , or mathematics for polytechnic or technology institutes . These terminal degrees , as in the case of the PhD in other countries , were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher . In the professional realm , a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual . However , in 2004 , the National Council of Higher Education ( CONESUP ) , started the reorganization of all the degree - granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts . The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects , credits , or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas . The terminal degree in law , previously known as JD Juris Doctor ( Doctor en Jurisprudencia ) was replaced by the one of abogado ( attorney ) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree . In the same fashion for medical school , the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years ( the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery ) to almost five , with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore , and it is given with the title of m\u00e9dico ( medic ) . Therefore , an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts . Nonetheless , a `` m\u00e9dico '' can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician . Municipal Library of Guayaquil This new reorganization , although very ambitious , lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions . One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians . As today , a master 's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of rector ( president of a university ) or d\u00e9cano ( dean ) . For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country , these regulations sounded illogical , disappointing , and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement . A debate to modify this and other reforms , especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government , was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4 , 2010 , but vetoed by President Rafael Correa , who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES ( National Secretary of Planning and Development ) . Due to this change , there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87 % of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master 's degree , and fewer than 5 % have a PhD ( although many of them already have Ecuadorian - granted doctorate degrees ) . About 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training . Sciences and research EXA 's first satellite , NEE - 01 Pegasus Ecuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology . The most notable icons in Ecuadorian sciences are the mathematician and cartographer Pedro Vicente Maldonado , born in Riobamba in 1707 , and the printer , independence precursor , and medical pioneer Eugenio Espejo , born in 1747 in Quito . Among other notable Ecuadorian scientists and engineers are Lieutenant Jose Rodriguez Lavandera , a pioneer who built the first submarine in Latin America in 1837 ; Reinaldo Espinosa Aguilar ( 1898 -- 1950 ) , a botanist and biologist of Andean flora ; and Jos\u00e9 Aurelio Due\u00f1as ( 1880 -- 1961 ) , a chemist and inventor of a method of textile serigraphy . The major areas of scientific research in Ecuador have been in the medical fields , tropical and infectious diseases treatments , agricultural engineering , pharmaceutical research , and bioengineering . Being a small country and a consumer of foreign technology , Ecuador has favored research supported by entrepreneurship in information technology . The antivirus program Checkprogram , banking protection system MdLock , and Core Banking Software Cobis are products of Ecuadorian development . The scientific production in hard sciences has been limited due to lack of funding but focused around physics , statistics , and partial differential equations in mathematics . In the case of engineering fields , the majority of scientific production comes from the top three polytechnic institutions : Escuela Superior Polit\u00e9cnica del Litoral - ESPOL , Universidad de Las Fuerzas Armadas - ESPE , and Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Nacional EPN . The Center for Research and Technology Development in Ecuador is an autonomous center for research and technology development funded by Senecyt . EPN is known for research and education in the applied science , astronomy , atmospheric physics , engineering and physical sciences . The Geophysics Institute monitors over the country 's volcanoes in the Andes Mountains of Ecuador and in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands , all of which is part of the Ring of Fire . EPN adopted the polytechnic university model that stresses laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering . The oldest observatory in South America is the Quito Astronomical Observatory and is located in Quito , Ecuador . The Quito Astronomical Observatory , which gives the global community of a Virtual Telescope System that is connected via the Internet and allows the world to watch by streaming , is managed by EPN . Contemporary Ecuadorian scientists who have been recognized by international institutions are Eugenia del Pino ( born 1945 ) , the first Ecuadorian to be elected to the United States National Academy of Science , and Arturo Villavicencio , who was part of the working group of the IPCC , which shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore for their dissemination of the effects of climate change . Currently , the politics of research and investigation are managed by the National Secretary of Higher Education , Science , and Technology ( Senescyt ) .

{"document_plaintext":"Nimbostratus cloud - wikipedia Nimbostratus cloud Jump to : navigation , search Nimbostratus cloud Nimbostratus with fractus Abbreviation Ns Symbol Genus Nimbostratus ( rain , layered ) Species none Variety none Altitude below 3,000 m ( below 10,000 ft ) Appearance Dark , widespread , formless layer Precipitation cloud ? Yes , but may be virga Nimbostratus is a stratiform genus formerly classified as `` Family C '' low - level , but now considered by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) to be a middle - or multi-level stratus type. . Although it is usually a low - based cloud , it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels . This change in classification would once have made it a `` Family D '' cloud , but this style of letter - based family nomenclature was discontinued by the WMO in 1956 . Nimbostratus usually produces precipitation over a wide area . Nimbo - is from the Latin word nimbus , which denotes precipitation . Downward - growing nimbostratus can have the same vertical extent as most large upward - growing cumulus , but its horizontal extent tends to be even greater . This sometimes leads to the exclusion of nimbostratus from the group of vertical clouds by some independent meteorologists and educators . Classifications that follow this approach usually show nimbostratus as low - level based on its normal base height range . Contents ( hide ) 1 Appearance 2 Formation 3 Forecast 4 Origin of name 5 Subtypes and derivative types 6 Relation to other clouds 7 References 8 External links Appearance ( edit ) Nimbostratus has a diffuse cloud base generally found anywhere from near surface in the low levels to about 3,000 m ( 9,800 ft ) in the middle level of the troposphere . Although usually dark at its base , it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer . Nimbostratus usually has a thickness of about 2000 to 4000 m . Though found worldwide , nimbostratus occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes . It is coded C 2 on the SYNOP report . Formation ( edit ) Nimbostratus occurs along a warm front or occluded front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates nimbostratus along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain , these clouds being preceded by higher - level clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus . Often , when an altostratus cloud thickens and descends into lower altitudes , it will become nimbostratus . Nimbostratus , unlike cumulonimbus , is not associated with thunderstorms , however at an unusually unstable warm front caused as a result of the advancing warm air being hot , humid and unstable , cumulonimbus clouds may be embedded within the usual nimbostratus . Lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the nimbostratus but only in the immediate area around it . In this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground , however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours . The occurrence of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus together is uncommon , and usually only nimbostratus is found at a warm front . Forecast ( edit ) Nimbostrati often have very few visual features . Nimbostratus is generally a sign of an approaching warm or occluded front producing steady moderate precipitation , as opposed to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a cold - frontal cumulonimbus cloud . Precipitation may last for several days , depending on the speed of the frontal system . A nimbostratus virga cloud is the same as normal nimbostratus , but the rain or snow falls as virga which does n't reach the ground . Stratus or stratocumulus usually replace the nimbostratus after the passage of the warm or occluded front . Origin of name ( edit ) Further information : Cloud \u00a7 History of cloud science and nomenclature Under Luke Howard 's first systematized study of clouds , carried out in France in 1802 , three general cloud forms were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation : cirriform , cumiliform and stratiform . These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude . In addition to these three main types , Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together : cumulostratus , a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers , and nimbus , a complex blending of cirriform , cumuliform , and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation . Later , in the 20th Century , an IMC commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus , effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type . It was then renamed nimbostratus , and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky . This left cumulonimbus as the only nimbiform type as indicated by its root - name . Subtypes and derivative types ( edit ) Species and varieties : Nimbostratus is very thick , opaque , and featureless , so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties . Precipitation - based supplementary features : Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features . The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud 's vertical depth . Accessory cloud : Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck. Pannus is coded C 7 . Genitus mother clouds : This genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus . Mutatus mother clouds : Nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus , altostratus and stratocumulus . Relation to other clouds ( edit ) Multi-level nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genus - types by way of being non-convective in nature . However , the other sheet - like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time . Stratus clouds are low - level and form from near ground level to 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) at all latitudes . In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from 2,000 metres ( 6,600 ft ) to 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in polar areas , 7,000 metres ( 23,000 ft ) in temperate areas , and 7,600 metres ( 24,900 ft ) in tropical areas . Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere , strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high - level . The main hight - level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun . Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of 3,000 to 7,600 metres ( 9,800 to 24,900 ft ) in high latitudes , 5,000 to 12,000 metres ( 16,000 to 39,000 ft ) in temperate latitudes , and 6,100 to 18,000 metres ( 20,000 to 59,100 ft ) in low , tropical latitudes . Of the non-stratiform clouds , cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation . The remaining cumuliform ( cumulus ) and stratocumuliform ( stratocumulus , altocumulus , and cirrocumulus ) clouds have the least in common with nimbostratus .

The album was promoted through various commercials presented by Samsung and was not preceded by any retail singles . Upon its release , Magna Carta Holy Grail was met with mixed reviews from music critics . Some complimented the album 's production and composition , while others were disappointed with its overall theme and found many songs repetitive . On the day of its physical release in the United States , the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies .

By May 2012 , reports arose that he was working on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats . In an interview with XXL , Beats stated : `` Me and Jay - Z been going back and forth . He picked a couple of my joints that he 's working on . I do n't even wan na say too much about Jay , but we definitely working on some stuff . I have n't even sent him a bunch of beats . I sent him my favorite stuff . He hit me right back like , ' Yo , I'ma go in on this , ' or , ' I like this . ' '' The album development was kept a secret , but The - Dream hinted about a new Jay - Z album in an April 2013 interview with Hot 97 . Leading up to the album 's announcement , Jay - Z served as an executive producer for both the film The Great Gatsby and its soundtrack , The Great Gatsby : Music from Baz Luhrmann 's Film , which he and film director Baz Luhrmann worked together for two years . The opening song , `` 100 $ Bill '' by Jay - Z contains a chopped and screwed beat , electro - rap elements and is written in the perspective of a modern - day Gatsby , it was both co-written and produced by E * vax one half of electronic rock duo Ratatat . Recording and production ( edit ) Timbaland provided the bulk of the production on the album . In late 2011 , it was confirmed three songs had been recorded and one of which featured Frank Ocean which would end up being `` Oceans '' , the oldest song that appeared on the album . The recording for `` Oceans '' and production for `` Holy Grail '' were completed in 2011 , during the recording sessions for Jay 's collaborative album with Kanye West , Watch the Throne . West wanted the two songs to appear on Watch the Throne , however Jay - Z chose to keep them for Magna Carta Holy Grail . After Watch the Throne was released , Jay - Z chose to go on a worldwide concert tour instead of devoting more time for the album . Following the end of the tour , the main bulk of recording sessions for Magna Carta Holy Grail took place at Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz ' Jungle City Studios in New York , where Justin Timberlake and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles were also working on their albums at the time . Jay - Z described the recording process as having a `` minimalist approach '' to give Magna Carta Holy Grail a `` 1990s feel '' . While working on Beyonc\u00e9 's fifth studio album , frequent collaborator Timbaland played Jay - Z the instrumental for what would become `` Picasso Baby '' . According to Jay - Z , that song built the sound of the album . Jay - Z and Timbaland had grown apart after they worked on The Blueprint 3 , but reunited for this album . Timbaland ended up handling the majority of the production on Magna Carta Holy Grail . In an interview with BBC Radio 1 , Jay - Z stated that while the two have recorded many songs in the past , it was not until Magna Carta Holy Grail that they got the chemistry to collaborate for a whole project . Producer J - Roc described `` Picasso Baby '' as `` just New York '' . He told XXL that him and Timbaland `` were really just feeling the city , the energy that it gives out '' and were inspired by the `` numerous different cultures and different dialects or sounds . '' Justin Timberlake makes three appearances on the album . The instrumental for `` FuckWithMeYouKnowIGotIt '' was started by producer Vinylz , who was inspired by a Pimp C speech he found on YouTube . He sampled Pimp C 's voice for the intro and then created the instrumental in a short amount of time . After fellow producer Boi - 1da added to the production , the song was sent to Rick Ross who intended to use it for his upcoming album . Jay - Z was meant to add a guest verse to it , but when he heard the instrumental , he wanted the track for his album . Timbaland added additional changes to it before they mastered the final version . In 2012 , Jay - Z contacted GOOD Music producer Hit - Boy about working together on Magna Carta Holy Grail . Hit - Boy created the instrumental for `` Somewhereinamerica '' , a song that was initially supposed to appear on the debut album of Grand Hustle artist Travis Scott . While in the studio with Jay - Z , Scott played the instrumental for him and Jay - Z instantly liked it . The instrumental for the song `` Crown '' was made by 16 - year - old Canadian producer WondaGurl . She had collaborated with Travis Scott on his Owl Pharaoh mixtape and went on to produce another track for his upcoming album . Scott liked the instrumental and started to build upon it with Mike Dean . The two then gave it to Jay - Z who recorded `` Crown '' over it . Overall , Jay - Z worked extensively on the album 's production with producers such as Swizz Beatz , Timbaland and Pharrell Williams who were also featured in the Samsung commercials promoting Magna Carta Holy Grail . He had also worked on the album 's production with Jahlil Beats , Boi - 1da , Mike Dean , Kanye West and Mike Will Made It , among others . He had also been seen in the studio with various recording artists such as Drake , The - Dream , Raekwon , Nas , and Timberlake working on the album . The final track listing revealed guest appearances by Timberlake , Frank Ocean , Nas , Pharrell , Swizz Beatz , Rick Ross and Beyonc\u00e9 among others . Release and promotion ( edit ) See also : Legends of the Summer , Magna Carter World Tour , and On the Run Tour ( Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay - Z ) On June 16 , 2013 , during the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals , Jay - Z was featured in a new commercial by Samsung where he announced that his twelfth studio album would be titled , Magna Carta Holy Grail and would be released on July 4 , 2013 . He was seen speaking to producer Rick Rubin in the studio about the album saying , `` ( It ) is about , like this duality of how do you navigate through this whole thing , through success , through failures , through all this and remain yourself . '' The commercial featured producers that are confirmed to be on the album including Timbaland , Swizz Beatz and Pharrell Williams . The album was made available for free download on July 4 , 12 : 01 a.m. EST , to the first one million Samsung Galaxy S III , Samsung Galaxy S4 and Samsung Galaxy Note II users of a new app . Shortly after , Billboard said that the Samsung deal would not count towards the sales figures used by Nielsen SoundScan to compile their charts . The album was then released for retail sale three days later , on July 7 , 2013 . Leading up to the release of the album , Jay - Z released selected lyrics of each song daily , via the Samsung app . This included `` Holy Grail '' , `` Heaven '' , `` Oceans '' , `` Part II ( On the Run ) '' , `` BBC '' , `` Jay Z Blue '' , `` Versus '' , `` La Familia '' , `` Tom Ford '' , `` Beach Is Better '' , `` Crown '' , `` Picasso Baby '' , `` F.U.T.W. '' , `` Nickels & Dimes '' and `` SomewhereInAmerica '' in order . On July 3 , 2013 , the cover art of the album was revealed in a photo where it was placed next to the one of the four surviving copies of album 's namesake ( the 13th - century English charter ) in Salisbury Cathedral , England , and it remained on display there until the end of July . The logo for the album was inspired by an art piece by Be Andr from 2009 named ' Untitled ( art ) ' . During the 2013 Grammy Awards , Timberlake and Jay - Z performed their hit single `` Suit & Tie '' . Following their appearance on Grammys , rumors of a stadium tour between the artists were raised as a result of Jay - Z 's posts on his Life + Times website ; he posted series of venues with the note `` # LegendsOfSummer this week '' . The Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour was officially announced on February 22 , 2013 . The tour begun on July 14 , 2013 in London , England . Starting in October 2013 , Jay - Z toured Europe on the Magna Carter World Tour . It begun on October 3 at the Manchester Arena in Manchester , England and concluded on October 29 at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam , Netherlands . The North American leg followed that , and it ended on January 31 , 2014 . Singles ( edit ) On April 11 , 2013 , Jay - Z released the first song from the album titled `` Open Letter '' . The song was a response to the critics of his fifth wedding anniversary that took place in Cuba . This was due to the current United States embargo against Cuba , which required them needing a permit to visit the country . The song was produced by Swizz Beatz , and was included on the album as a bonus track . On July 10 , 2013 , Third Man Records announced on their website that they had entered a deal to release Magna Carta Holy Grail on vinyl , also confirming that `` Open Letter '' would be included as a vinyl - only bonus track and that there would be `` something ( else ) very special planned for the vinyl edition . '' However , the ' vinyl - only ' appearance of `` Open Letter '' has been shown to not apply to all market areas . Third Man Records is set to issue `` Open Letter '' in the form of a vinyl single designed as a playable letter . In an interview with Hot 97 , Jay - Z went into detail about the single 's release , saying : `` It 's in a letter . You can play the letter . It 's amazing ... You open the letter , and you can actually play the card . '' The song `` Holy Grail '' features vocals from singer Justin Timberlake and served as the album 's first single . It was produced by The - Dream , Timbaland and Jerome `` J - Roc '' Harmon , with additional production from No ID and containing elements of Nirvana 's 1991 hit single `` Smells Like Teen Spirit '' . Following the release of the album , the song debuted at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 24 on the UK Singles Chart . The song has since peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 . The music video was released on August 29 , 2013 , making social media history as the first time a clip from major artists debuted strictly on Facebook . On September 26 , 2013 , the album 's second single `` Tom Ford '' was serviced to urban contemporary radio in the United Kingdom and then on October 15 , 2013 , to rhythmic contemporary in the United States . Prior to its single release , the song peaked at number 39 on the US Billboard Hot 100 . `` Part II ( On the Run ) '' featuring Beyonc\u00e9 was serviced to contemporary hit radio stations on February 18 , 2014 as the album 's third single . The song has since peaked at number 80 on the Billboard Hot 100 . Critical reception ( edit ) Professional ratings Aggregate scores Source Rating AnyDecentMusic ? 5.4 \/ 10 Metacritic 60 \/ 100 Review scores Source Rating AllMusic The A.V. Club C -- The Daily Telegraph Los Angeles Times MSN Music B+ NME 6 \/ 10 Pitchfork 5.8 \/ 10 Rolling Stone Spin 5 \/ 10 The Times Magna Carta Holy Grail received generally mixed reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 60 , based on 42 reviews . In The New York Times , Jon Pareles wrote that Jay - Z was trying to transition from his pop sensibilities but had not yet found a `` reliable alternative '' on Magna Carta Holy Grail , where his raps were often mismatched with rigidly produced tracks . AllMusic 's Andy Kellman believed the record was hastily produced and despite occasionally impressive lyrics , Jay - Z 's pop culture references sounded reflexive . Spin magazine 's Jordan Sargent said the songs sounded at once overly elaborate and unfinished , along with similar but less momentous themes in comparison to Watch the Throne . Jesse Cataldo from Slant Magazine deemed it a self - important album marred by shallow name - dropping , while accusing Jay - Z of becoming disinterested creatively because of his increased success . Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club felt the rapper had exhausted the end of his rags to riches narrative and was unable to reinvent himself beyond gloating superficially about his riches . The Daily Telegraph 's Helen Brown found his boastful references heavy - handed and the album unchallenging , albeit enjoyable for `` the lazy listener '' . Greg Kot wrote in the Chicago Tribune viewed that , apart from well - written moments on `` Oceans '' , `` Jay - Z Blue '' , and `` Nickel & Dimes '' , most of the album was inconsequential . In a generally positive review , Randall Roberts from the Los Angeles Times was impressed by the production 's energy and samples , even though he thought the album was not as intellectual or adventurous as its title suggests . Uncut wrote that it mostly succeeded as an attempt by Jay - Z to `` balance his great wealth , tough history and news responsibility while retaining his grit . '' NME critic Louis Pattison said it lacked a radical presence such as Kanye West to complement Jay - Z 's mature ruminations , but nonetheless showed him as a sagacious lyricist comparable with Bruce Springsteen or Bob Dylan . In The Observer , Kitty Empire believed that while the diverse production would appeal to listeners at first rather than Jay - Z 's predictably `` umpteenth retelling '' of his rags - to - riches story , the topics become more interesting on subsequent listens because of his surprisingly concerned takes on fatherhood and charity . Robert Christgau from MSN Music said he was won over after several listens by the familial songs , which he found amusing on a record that pits `` black man as artistic rebel versus black man as family stalwart '' . Accolades ( edit ) Closing out the year , Magna Carta Holy Grail was met with many accolades and was named in multiple `` Albums of the Year '' lists by major publications . It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards and for Best Rap Album at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards . Complex ranked the album at number 23 , on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013 . They praised the `` high - gloss production , '' and strong rhymes by Jay - Z , deeming it `` very listenable '' . Rolling Stone named it the tenth best hip hop album of the 2013 saying , `` The legendary MC explored of - the - moment sounds , textures and tempos in ways only he could ( ... ) Even on a bit of an off day , Jay is still plenty impressive . '' It was named the eighth best album of 2013 by XXL . Year Ceremony Category Result 2014 Billboard Music Awards Top Rap Album Nominated Commercial performance ( edit ) Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week , which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000 .

Cole 's Born Sinner .

{"document_plaintext":"Somatic cell nuclear transfer - wikipedia Somatic cell nuclear transfer Jump to : navigation , search Somatic cell nuclear transfer can create clones for both reproductive and therapeutic purposes . The diagram depicts the removal of the donor nucleus for schematic purposes ; in practice the whole donor cell is transferred . In genetics and developmental biology , somatic cell nuclear transfer ( SCNT ) is a laboratory strategy for creating a viable embryo from a body cell and an egg cell . The technique consists of taking an enucleated oocyte ( egg cell ) and implanting a donor nucleus from a somatic ( body ) cell . It is used in both therapeutic and reproductive cloning . Dolly the Sheep became famous for being the first successful case of the reproductive cloning of a mammal . In January 2018 , a team of scientists in Shanghai announced the successful cloning of two female crab - eating macaques ( named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua ) from fetal nuclei . `` Therapeutic cloning '' refers to the potential use of SCNT in regenerative medicine ; this approach has been championed as an answer to the many issues concerning embryonic stem cells ( ESC ) and the destruction of viable embryos for medical use , though questions remain on how homologous the two cell types truly are . Wikinews has related news : Healthy cloned monkeys born in Shanghai Contents ( hide ) 1 Introduction 2 Process 3 Applications 3.1 Stem cell research 3.2 Reproductive cloning 3.3 Interspecies nuclear transfer 4 Limitations 5 Controversy 6 Policies regarding human SCNT 7 See also 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links Introduction ( edit ) It is a technique for cloning in which the nucleus of a somatic cell is transferred to the cytoplasm of an enucleated egg . When this is done , the cytoplasmic factors affect the nucleus to become a zygote . The blastocyst stage is developed by the egg which helps to create embryonic stem cells from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst . The first animal that was developed by this technique was Dolly , the sheep , in 1996 . Process ( edit ) The process of somatic cell nuclear transplant involves two different cells . The first being a female gamete , known as the ovum ( egg \/ oocyte ) . In human SCNT ( Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer ) experiments , these eggs are obtained through consenting donors , utilizing ovarian stimulation . The second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body . Skin cells , fat cells , and liver cells are only a few examples . The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded , leaving it ' deprogrammed . ' What is left is a somatic cell and an denucleated egg cell . These are then fused by inserting the somatic cell into the ' empty ' ovum . After being inserted into the egg , the somatic cell nucleus is reprogrammed by its host egg cell . The ovum , now containing the somatic cell 's nucleus , is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide . The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent . Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions , this single cell forms a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with an identical genome to the original organism ( i.e. a clone ) . Stem cells can then be obtained by the destruction of this clone embryo for use in therapeutic cloning or in the case of reproductive cloning the clone embryo is implanted into a host mother for further development and brought to term . Applications ( edit ) Stem cell research ( edit ) Somatic cell nuclear transplantation has become a focus of study in stem cell research . The aim of carrying out this procedure is to obtain pluripotent cells from a cloned embryo . These cells genetically matched the donor organism from which they came . This gives them the ability to create patient specific pluripotent cells , which could then be used in therapies or disease research . Embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated cells of an embryo . These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential because they have the ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism . This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type , which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells . Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable human embryos . Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells , SCNT is one such method . A potential use of stem cells genetically matched to a patient would be to create cell lines that have genes linked to a patient 's particular disease . By doing so , an in vitro model could be created , would be useful for studying that particular disease , potentially discovering its pathophysiology , and discovering therapies . For example , if a person with Parkinson 's disease donated his or her somatic cells , the stem cells resulting from SCNT would have genes that contribute to Parkinson 's disease . The disease specific stem cell lines could then be studied in order to better understand the condition . Another application of SCNT stem cell research is using the patient specific stem cell lines to generate tissues or even organs for transplant into the specific patient . The resulting cells would be genetically identical to the somatic cell donor , thus avoiding any complications from immune system rejection . Only a handful of the labs in the world are currently using SCNT techniques in human stem cell research . In the United States , scientists at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute , the University of California San Francisco , the Oregon Health & Science University , Stemagen ( La Jolla , CA ) and possibly Advanced Cell Technology are currently researching a technique to use somatic cell nuclear transfer to produce embryonic stem cells . In the United Kingdom , the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has granted permission to research groups at the Roslin Institute and the Newcastle Centre for Life . SCNT may also be occurring in China . In 2005 , a South Korean research team led by Professor Hwang Woo - suk , published claims to have derived stem cell lines via SCNT , but supported those claims with fabricated data . Recent evidence has proved that he in fact created a stem cell line from a parthenote . Though there has been numerous successes with cloning animals , questions remain concerning the mechanisms of reprogramming in the ovum . Despite many attempts , success in creating human nuclear transfer embryonic stem cells has been limited . There lies a problem in the human cell 's ability to form a blastocyst ; the cells fail to progress past the eight cell stage of development . This is thought to be a result from the somatic cell nucleus being unable to turn on embryonic genes crucial for proper development . These earlier experiments used procedures developed in non-primate animals with little success . A research group from the Oregon Health & Science University demonstrated SCNT procedures developed for primates successfully using skin cells . The key to their success was utilizing oocytes in metaphase II ( MII ) of the cell cycle . Egg cells in MII contain special factors in the cytoplasm that have a special ability in reprogramming implanted somatic cell nuclei into cells with pluripotent states . When the ovum 's nucleus is removed , the cell loses its genetic information . This has been blamed for why enucleated eggs are hampered in their reprogramming ability . It is theorized the critical embryonic genes are physically linked to oocyte chromosomes , enucleation negatively affects these factors . Another possibility is removing the egg nucleus or inserting the somatic nucleus causes damage to the cytoplast , affecting reprogramming ability . Taking this into account the research group applied their new technique in an attempt to produce human SCNT stem cells . In May 2013 , the Oregon group reported the successful derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines derived through SCNT , using fetal and infant donor cells . Using MII oocytes from volunteers and their improved SCNT procedure , human clone embryos were successfully produced . These embryos were of poor quality , lacking a substantial inner cell mass and poorly constructed trophectoderm . The imperfect embryos prevented the acquisition of human ESC . The addition of caffeine during the removal of the ovum 's nucleus and injection of the somatic nucleus improved blastocyst formation and ESC isolation . The ESC obtain were found to be capable of producing teratomas , expressed pluripotent transcription factors , and expressed a normal 46XX karyotype , indicating these SCNT were in fact ESC - like . This was the first instance of successfully using SCNT to reprogram human somatic cells . This study used fetal and infantile somatic cells to produce their ESC . In April 2014 , an international research team expanded on this break through . There remained the question of whether the same success could be accomplished using adult somatic cells . Epigenetic and age related changes were thought to possibly hinder an adult somatic cells ability to be reprogrammed . Implementing the procedure pioneered by the Oregon research group they indeed were able to grow stem cells generated by SCNT using adult cells from two donors , aged 35 and 75. Indicating age does not impede a cells ability to be reprogrammed Late April 2014 , the New York Stem Cell Foundation was successful in creating SCNT stem cells derived from adult somatic cells . One of these lines of stem cells was derived from the donor cells of a type 1 diabetic . The group was then able to successfully culture these stem cells and induce differentiation . When injected into mice , cells of all three of the germ layers successfully formed . The most significant of these cells , were those who expressed insulin and were capable of secreting the hormone . These insulin producing cells could be used for replacement therapy in diabetics , demonstrating real SCNT stem cell therapeutic potential . The impetus for SCNT - based stem cell research has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells . Methods to reprogram normal body cells into pluripotent stem cells were developed in humans in 2007 . The following year , this method achieved a key goal of SCNT - based stem cell research : the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases . Some scientists working on SCNT - based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells . Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells . Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into . For instance , an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells , while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron . This raises the question of how well iPS cells can mimic the gold standard ESC in experiments , as stem cells are defined as having the ability to differentiate into any cell type . SCNT stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies . Reproductive cloning ( edit ) Main article : Cloning BTX ECM 2001 Electrofusion generator used for SCNT and Cloning applications This technique is currently the basis for cloning animals ( such as the famous Dolly the sheep ) , and has been theoretically proposed as a possible way to clone humans . Using SCNT in reproductive cloning has proven difficult with limited success . High fetal and neonatal death make the process very inefficient . Resulting cloned offspring are also plagued with development and imprinting disorders in non-human species . For these reasons , along with moral and ethical objections , reproductive cloning in humans is proscribed in more than 30 countries . Most researchers believe that in the foreseeable future it will not be possible to use the current cloning technique to produce a human clone that will develop to term . It remains a possibility , though critical adjustments will be required to overcome current limitations during early embryonic development in human SCNT . There is also the potential for treating diseases associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA . Recent studies show SCNT of the nucleus of a body cell afflicted with one of these diseases into a healthy oocyte prevents the inheritance of the mitochondrial disease . This treatment does not involve cloning but would produce a child with three genetic parents . A father providing a sperm cell , one mother providing the egg nucleus and another mother providing the enucleated egg cell . In 2018 , the first successful cloning of primates using somatic cell nuclear transfer , the same method as Dolly the sheep , with the birth of two live female clones ( crab - eating macaques named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua ) was reported . Interspecies nuclear transfer ( edit ) Interspecies nuclear transfer ( iSCNT ) is a means of somatic cell nuclear transfer used to facilitate the rescue of endangered species , or even to restore species after their extinction . The technique is similar to SCNT cloning which typically is between domestic animals and rodents , or where there is a ready supply of oocytes and surrogate animals . However , the cloning of highly endangered or extinct species requires the use of an alternative method of cloning . Interspecies nuclear transfer utilizes a host and a donor of two different organisms that are closely related species and within the same genus . In 2000 , Robert Lanza was able to produce a cloned fetus of a gaur , Bos gaurus , combining it successfully with a domestic cow , Bos taurus . Interspecies nuclear transfer provides evidence of the universality of the triggering mechanism of the cell nucleus reprogramming . For example , Gupta et al. , explored the possibility of producing transgenic cloned embryos by interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer ( iSCNT ) of cattle , mice , and chicken donor cells into enucleated pig oocytes . Moreover , NCSU23 medium , which was designed for in vitro culture of pig embryos , was able to support the in vitro development of cattle , mice , and chicken iSCNT embryos up to the blastocyst stage . Furthermore , ovine oocyte cytoplast may be used for remodeling and reprogramming of human somatic cells back to the embryonic stage . Limitations ( edit ) This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( August 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) SCNT can be inefficient . Stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus in early research were enormous , resulting in a low percentage of successfully reprogrammed cells . For example , in 1996 Dolly the sheep was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT , which created 29 viable embryos . Only three of these embryos survived until birth , and only one survived to adulthood . As the procedure was not automated , but had to be performed manually under a microscope , SCNT was very resource intensive . The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the differentiated somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from understood . However , by 2014 , researchers were reporting success rates of 70 - 80 % with cloning pigs and in 2016 a Korean company , Sooam Biotech , was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos a day . In SCNT , not all of the donor cell 's genetic information is transferred , as the donor cell 's mitochondria that contain their own mitochondrial DNA are left behind . The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg . As a consequence , clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus . This fact may also hamper the potential benefits of SCNT derived tissues \/ organs for therapy , as there may be an immunoresponse to the non-self mtDNA after transplant . Controversy ( edit ) Further information : stem cell controversy Human Blastocyst , showing the inner cell mass ( top , right ) . Proposals to use nucleus transfer techniques in human stem cell research raise a set of concerns beyond the moral status of any created embryo . These have led to some individuals and organizations who are not opposed to human embryonic stem cell research to be concerned about , or opposed to , SCNT research . One concern is that blastula creation in SCNT - based human stem cell research will lead to the reproductive cloning of humans . Both processes use the same first step : the creation of a nuclear transferred embryo , most likely via SCNT . Those who hold this concern often advocate for strong regulation of SCNT to preclude implantation of any derived products for the intention of human reproduction , or its prohibition . A second important concern is the appropriate source of the eggs that are needed . SCNT requires human eggs , which can only be obtained from women . The most common source of these eggs today are eggs that are produced and in excess of the clinical need during IVF treatment . This is a minimally invasive procedure , but it does carry some health risks , such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome . One vision for successful stem cell therapies is to create custom stem cell lines for patients . Each custom stem cell line would consist of a collection of identical stem cells each carrying the patient 's own DNA , thus reducing or eliminating any problems with rejection when the stem cells were transplanted for treatment . For example , to treat a man with Parkinson 's disease , a cell nucleus from one of his cells would be transplanted by SCNT into an egg cell from an egg donor , creating a unique lineage of stem cells almost identical to the patient 's own cells . ( There would be differences . For example , the mitochondrial DNA would be the same as that of the egg donor . In comparison , his own cells would carry the mitochondrial DNA of his mother . ) Potentially millions of patients could benefit from stem cell therapy , and each patient would require a large number of donated eggs in order to successfully create a single custom therapeutic stem cell line . Such large numbers of donated eggs would exceed the number of eggs currently left over and available from couples trying to have children through assisted reproductive technology . Therefore , healthy young women would need to be induced to sell eggs to be used in the creation of custom stem cell lines that could then be purchased by the medical industry and sold to patients . It is so far unclear where all these eggs would come from . Stem cell experts consider it unlikely that such large numbers of human egg donations would occur in a developed country because of the unknown long - term public health effects of treating large numbers of healthy young women with heavy doses of hormones in order to induce hyperovulation ( ovulating several eggs at once ) . Although such treatments have been performed for several decades now , the long - term effects have not been studied or declared safe to use on a large scale on otherwise healthy women . Longer - term treatments with much lower doses of hormones are known to increase the rate of cancer decades later . Whether hormone treatments to induce hyperovulation could have similar effects is unknown . There are also ethical questions surrounding paying for eggs . In general , marketing body parts is considered unethical and is banned in most countries . Human eggs have been a notable exception to this rule for some time . To address the problem of creating a human egg market , some stem cell researchers are investigating the possibility of creating artificial eggs . If successful , human egg donations would not be needed to create custom stem cell lines . However , this technology may be a long way off . Policies regarding human SCNT ( edit ) SCNT involving human cells is currently legal for research purposes in the United Kingdom , having been incorporated into the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 . Permission must be obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in order to perform or attempt SCNT . In the United States , the practice remains legal , as it has not been addressed by federal law . However , in 2002 , a moratorium on United States federal funding for SCNT prohibits funding the practice for the purposes of research . Thus , though legal , SCNT can not be federally funded . American scholars have recently argued that because the product of SCNT is a clone embryo , rather than a human embryo , these policies are morally wrong and should be revised . In 2003 , the United Nations adopted a proposal submitted by Costa Rica , calling on member states to `` prohibit all forms of human cloning in as much as they are incompatible with human dignity and the protection of human life . '' This phrase may include SCNT , depending on interpretation . The Council of Europe 's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and its Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine , on the Prohibition of Cloning Human Being appear to ban SCNT of human beings . Of the Council 's 45 member states , the Convention has been signed by 31 and ratified by 18 . The Additional Protocol has been signed by 29 member nations and ratified by 14 .

{"document_plaintext":"Interphase - wikipedia Interphase Jump to : navigation , search Not to be confused with Interface ( chemistry ) . This article is about the phase in the cell cycle .

Note : Cytoplasm of this cell or the neighboring cell is not visible ( top - left ) , which is currently in the telophase of mitosis . Image taken using an optical microscope and DAPI staining of DNA . Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life . During this phase , the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis . Interphase is the ' daily living ' or metabolic phase of the cell , in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them , grows , reads its DNA , and conducts other `` normal '' cell functions . The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase . This phase was formerly called the resting phase . However , interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting ; rather , the cell is living , and preparing for later cell division , so the name was changed . A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis . However , since mitosis is the division of the nucleus , prophase is actually the first stage . In interphase , the cell gets itself ready for mitosis or meiosis . Somatic cells , or normal diploid cells of the body , go through mitosis in order to reproduce themselves through cell division , whereas diploid germ cells ( i.e. , primary spermatocytes and primary oocytes ) go through meiosis in order to create haploid gametes ( i.e. , sperm and ova ) for the purpose of sexual reproduction . Chromosomes are copied . Contents ( hide ) 1 Stages of interphase 2 Interphase within sequences of cellular processes 2.1 Interphase and the cell cycle 2.2 Interphase and other cellular processes 3 See also 4 References Stages of interphase ( edit ) There are three stages of cellular interphase , with each phase ending when a cellular checkpoint checks the accuracy of the stage 's completion before proceeding to the next . The stages of interphase are : G ( Gap 1 ) , in which the cell grows and functions normally . During this time , a high amount of protein synthesis occurs and the cell grows ( to about double its original size ) -- more organelles are produced and the volume of the cytoplasm increases . If the cell is not to divide again , it will enter G . Synthesis ( S ) , in which the cell duplicates its DNA ( via semiconservative replication ) . G ( Gap 2 ) , in which the cell resumes its growth in preparation for division . The mitochondria divide and the cell continues to grow until mitosis begins . In plants , chloroplasts also divide during G2 . In addition , some cells that do not divide often or ever , enter a stage called G ( Gap zero ) , which is either a stage separate from interphase or an extended G . The duration of time spent in interphase and in each stage of interphase is variable and depends on both the type of cell and the species of organism it belongs to . Most cells of adult mammals spend about 20 hours in interphase ; this accounts for about 90 % of the total time involved in cell division . Interphase includes G1 , S , and G2 phases . Mitosis and cytokinesis , however , are separate from interphase . Interphase within sequences of cellular processes ( edit ) Interphase and the cell cycle ( edit ) When G is completed , the cell enters a relatively brief period of nuclear and cellular division , composed of mitosis and cytokinesis , respectively . After the successful completion of mitosis and cytokinesis , both resulting daughter cells re-enter G of interphase . In the cell cycle , interphase is preceded by telophase and cytokinesis of the M phase . In alternative fashion , interphase is sometimes interrupted by G phase , which , in some circumstances , may then end and be followed by the remaining stages of interphase . After the successful completion of the G checkpoint , the final checkpoint in interphase , the cell proceeds to prophase , or in plants to preprophase , which is the first stage of mitosis . G phase is viewed as either an extended G phase where the cell is neither dividing nor preparing to divide and or as a distinct quiescent stage which occurs outside of the cell cycle . Interphase and other cellular processes ( edit ) In gamete production interphase is succeeded by meiosis . In programmed cell death , interphase is followed or preempted by apoptosis .

{"document_plaintext":"History of United States prison systems - wikipedia History of United States prison systems Jump to : navigation , search Eastern State Penitentiary , constructed in the 1820s during the first major wave of penitentiary building in the United States . Imprisonment as a form of criminal punishment only became widespread in the United States just before the American Revolution , though penal incarceration efforts had been ongoing in England since as early as the 1500s , and prisons in the form of dungeons and various detention facilities had existed since long before then . Prison building efforts in the United States came in three major waves . The first began during the Jacksonian Era and led to widespread use of imprisonment and rehabilitative labor as the primary penalty for most crimes in nearly all states by the time of the American Civil War . The second began after the Civil War and gained momentum during the Progressive Era , bringing a number of new mechanisms -- such as parole , probation , and indeterminate sentencing -- into the mainstream of American penal practice . Finally , since the early 1970s , the United States has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of its imprisonment systems at both the federal and state level . Since 1973 , the number of incarcerated persons in the United States has increased five-fold , and in a given year 7,000,000 people were under the supervision or control of correctional services in the United States . These periods of prison construction and reform produced major changes in the structure of prison systems and their missions , the responsibilities of federal and state agencies for administering and supervising them , as well as the legal and political status of prisoners themselves .

Hirsch . Before the nineteenth century , sentences of penal confinement were rare in the criminal courts of British North America . But penal incarceration had been utilized in England as early as the reign of the Tudors , if not before . When post-revolutionary prisons emerged in United States , they were , in Hirsch 's words , not a `` fundamental departure '' from the former American colonies ' intellectual past . Early American prisons systems like Massachusetts ' Castle Island Penitentiary , built in 1780 , essentially imitated the model of the 1500s English workhouse . The English workhouse ( edit ) See also : Workhouse `` The workroom at St James 's workhouse '' , from The Microcosm of London ( 1808 ) The English workhouse , an intellectual forerunner of early United States penitentiaries , was first developed as a `` cure '' for the idleness of the poor . Over time English officials and reformers came to see the workhouse as a more general system for rehabilitating criminals of all kinds . Common wisdom in the England of the 1500s attributed property crime to idleness . `` Idleness '' had been a status crime since Parliament enacted the Statute of Laborers in the mid-fourteenth century . By 1530 , English subjects convicted of leading a `` Rogishe or Vagabonds Trade or Lyfe '' were subject to whipping and mutilation , and recidivists could face the death penalty . In 1557 , many in England perceived that vagrancy was on the rise . That same year , the City of London reopened the Bridewell as a warehouse for vagrants arrested within the city limits . By order of any two of the Bridewell 's governors , a person could be committed to the prison for a term of custody ranging from several weeks to several years . In the decades that followed , `` houses of correction '' or `` workhouses '' like the Bridewell became a fixture of towns across England -- a change made permanent when Parliament began requiring every county in the realm to build a workhouse in 1576 . The workhouse was not just a custodial institution . At least some of its proponents hoped that the experience of incarceration would rehabilitate workhouse residents through hard labor . Supporters expressed the belief that forced abstinence from `` idleness '' would make vagrants into productive citizens . Other supporters argued that the threat of the workhouse would deter vagrancy , and that inmate labor could provide a means of support for the workhouse itself . Governance of these institutions was controlled by written regulations promulgated by local authorities , and local justices of the peace monitored compliance . Although `` vagrants '' were the first inhabitants of the workhouse -- not felons or other criminals -- expansion of its use to criminals was discussed . Sir Thomas More described in Utopia ( 1516 ) how an ideal government should punish citizens with slavery , not death , and expressly recommended use of penal enslavement in England . Thomas Starkey , chaplain to Henry VIII , suggested that convicted felons `` be put in some commyn work ... so by theyr life yet the commyn welth schold take some profit . '' Edward Hext , justice of the peace in Somersetshire in the 1500s , recommended that criminals be put to labor in the workhouse after receiving the traditional punishments of the day . Former workhouse in Nantwich , dating from 1780 During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , several programs experimented with sentencing various petty criminals to the workhouse . Many petty criminals were sentenced to the workhouse by way of the vagrancy laws even before these efforts . A commission appointed by King James I in 1622 to reprieve felons condemned to death with banishment to the American colonies was also given authority to sentence offenders `` to toyle in some such heavie and painful manuall workes and labors here at home and be kept in chains in the house of correction or other places , '' until the King or his ministers decided otherwise . Within three years , a growing body of laws authorized incarceration in the workhouse for specifically enumerated petty crimes . Throughout the 1700s , even as England 's `` Bloody Code '' took shape , incarceration at hard labor was held out as an acceptable punishment for criminals of various kinds -- e.g. , those who received a suspended death sentence via the benefit of clergy or a pardon , those who were not transported to the colonies , or those convicted of petty larceny . In 1779 -- at a time when the American Revolution had made convict transportation to North America impracticable -- the English Parliament passed the Penitentiary Act , mandating the construction of two London prisons with internal regulations modeled on the Dutch workhouse -- i.e. , prisoners would labor more or less constantly during the day , with their diet , clothing , and communication strictly controlled . Although the Penitentiary Act promised to make penal incarceration the focal point of English criminal law , a series of the penitentiaries it prescribed were never constructed . Despite the ultimate failure of the Penitentiary Act , however , the legislation marked the culmination of a series of legislative efforts that `` disclose ( ) the ... antiquity , continuity , and durability '' of rehabilitative incarceration ideology in Anglo - American criminal law , according to historian Adam J. Hirsch . The first United States penitentiaries involved elements of the early English workhouses -- hard labor by day and strict supervision of inmates . English philanthropist penology ( edit ) John Howard , English philanthropist penal reformer . A second group that supported penal incarceration in England included clergymen and `` lay pietists '' of various religious denominations who made efforts during the 1700s to reduce the severity of the English criminal justice system . Initially , reformers like John Howard focused on the harsh conditions of pre-trial detention in English jails . But many philanthropists did not limit their efforts to jail administration and inmate hygiene ; they were also interested in the spiritual health of inmates and curbing the common practice of mixing all prisoners together at random . Their ideas about inmate classification and solitary confinement match another undercurrent of penal innovation in the United States that persisted into the Progressive Era . Beginning with Samuel Denne 's Letter to Lord Ladbroke ( 1771 ) and Jonas Hanway 's Solitude in Imprisonment ( 1776 ) , philanthropic literature on English penal reform began to concentrate on the post-conviction rehabilitation of criminals in the prison setting . Although they did not speak with a single voice , the philanthropist penologists tended to view crime as an outbreak of the criminal 's estrangement from God . Hanway , for example , believed that the challenge of rehabilitating the criminal law lay in restoring his faith in , and fear of the Christian God , in order to `` qualify ( him ) for happiness in both worlds . '' Philanthropist penal reformer Jonas Hanway , author of Solitude in Imprisonment ( 1776 ) , circa 1785 . Many eighteenth - century English philanthropists proposed solitary confinement as a way to rehabilitate inmates morally . Since at least 1740 , philanthropic thinkers touted the use of penal solitude for two primary purposes : ( 1 ) to isolate prison inmates from the moral contagion of other prisoners , and ( 2 ) to jump - start their spiritual recovery . The philanthropists found solitude far superior to hard labor , which only reached the convict 's worldly self , failing to get at the underlying spiritual causes of crime . In their conception of prison as a `` penitentiary , '' or place of repentance for sin , the English philanthropists departed from Continental models and gave birth to a largely novel idea -- according to social historians Michael Meranze and Michael Ignatieff -- which in turn found its way into penal practice in the United States . A major political obstacle to implementing the philanthropists ' solitary program in England was financial : Building individual cells for each prisoner cost more than the congregate housing arrangements typical of eighteenth - century English jails . But by the 1790s , local solitary confinement facilities for convicted criminals appeared in Gloucestershire and several other English counties . The philanthropists ' focus on isolation and moral contamination became the foundation for early penitentiaries in the United States . Philadelphians of the period eagerly followed the reports of philanthropist reformer John Howard And the archetypical penitentiaries that emerged in the 1820s United States -- e.g. , Auburn and Eastern State penitentiaries -- both implemented a solitary regime aimed at morally rehabilitating prisoners . The concept of inmate classification -- or dividing prisoners according to their behavior , age , etc. -- remains in use in United States prisons to this day . Rationalist penology ( edit ) Cesare Beccaria , Italian rationalist penal reformer and author of On Crimes and Punishments ( 1764 ) . A third group involved in English penal reform were the `` rationalists '' or `` utlitarians '' . According to historian Adam J. Hirsch , eighteenth - century rationalist criminology `` rejected scripture in favor of human logic and reason as the only valid guide to constructing social institutions . Eighteenth - century rational philosophers like Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham developed a `` novel theory of crime '' -- specifically , that what made an action subject to criminal punishment was the harm it caused to other members of society . For the rationalists , sins that did not result in social harm were outside the purview of civil courts . With John Locke 's `` sensational psychology '' as a guide , which maintained that environment alone defined human behavior , many rationalists sought the roots of a criminal 's behavior in his or her past environment . Rationalists differed as to what environmental factors gave rise to criminality . Some rationalists , including Cesare Beccaria , blamed criminality on the uncertainty criminal punishment , whereas earlier criminologists had linked criminal deterrence to the severity of punishment . In essence , Beccaria believed that where arrest , conviction , and sentencing for crime were `` rapid and infallible , '' punishments for crime could remain moderate . Beccaria did not take issue with the substance of contemporary penal codes -- e.g. , whipping and the pillory ; rather , he took issue with their form and implementation . Jeremy Bentham , English rationalist penal reformer and designer of the Panopticon . Other rationalists , like Jeremy Bentham , believed that deterrence alone could not end criminality and looked instead to the social environment as the ultimate source of crime . Bentham 's conception of criminality led him to concur with philanthropist reformers on the need for rehabilitation of offenders . But , unlike the philanthropists , Bentham and like - minded rationalists believed the true goal of rehabilitation was to show convicts the logical `` inexpedience '' of crime , not their estrangement from religion . For these rationalists , society was the source of and the solution to crime . Ultimately , hard labor became the preferred rationalist therapy . Bentham eventually adopted this approach , and his well - known 1791 design for the Panopticon prison called for inmates to labor in solitary cells for the course of their imprisonment . Another rationalist , William Eden , collaborated with John Howard and Justice William Blackstone in drafting the Penitentiary Act of 1779 , which called for a penal regime of hard labor . According to social and legal historian Adam J. Hirsch , the rationalists had only a secondary impact on United States penal practices . But their ideas -- whether consciously adopted by United States prison reformers or not -- resonate in various United States penal initiatives to the present day . Historical development of United States prison systems ( edit ) Although convicts played a significant role in British settlement of North America , according to legal historian Adam J. Hirsch `` ( t ) he wholesale incarceration of criminals is in truth a comparatively recent episode in the history of Anglo - American jurisprudence . '' Imprisonment facilities were present from the earliest English settlement of North America , but the fundamental purpose of these facilities changed in the early years of United States legal history as a result of a geographically widespread `` penitentiary '' movement . The form and function of prison systems in the United States has continued to change as a result of political and scientific developments , as well as notable reform movements during the Jacksonian Era , Reconstruction Era , Progressive Era , and the 1970s . But the status of penal incarceration as the primary mechanism for criminal punishment has remained the same since its first emergence in the wake of the American Revolution . Early settlement , convict transportation , and the prisoner trade ( edit ) See also : Penal transportation Richard Hakluyt , promoter of large - scale English settlement in the Jamestown Colony by convicts , as depicted in stained glass in the west window of the south transept of Bristol Cathedral . Prisoners and prisons appeared in North America simultaneous to the arrival of European settlers . Among the ninety or so men who sailed with the explorer known as Christopher Columbus were a young black man abducted from the Canary Islands and at least four convicts . By 1570 , Spanish soldiers in St. Augustine , Florida , had built the first substantial prison in North America . As other European nations began to compete with Spain for land and wealth in the New World , they too turned to convicts to fill out the crews on their ships . According to social historian Marie Gottschalk , convicts were `` indispensable '' to English settlement efforts in what is now the United States . In the late sixteenth century , Richard Hakluyt called for the large - scale conscription of criminals to settle the New World for England . But official action on Haklyut 's proposal lagged until 1606 , when the English crown escalated its colonization efforts . Sir John Popham 's colonial venture in present - day Maine was stocked , a contemporary critic complained , `` out of all the gaols ( jails ) of England . '' The Virginia Company , the corporate entity responsible for settling Jamestown , authorized its colonists to seize Native American children wherever they could `` for conversion ... to the knowledge and worship of the true God and their redeemer , Christ Jesus . '' The colonists themselves lived , in effect , as prisoners of the Company 's governor and his agents . Men caught trying to escape were tortured to death ; seamstresses who erred in their sewing were subject to whipping . One Richard Barnes , accused of uttering `` base and detracting words '' against the governor , was ordered to be `` disarmed and have his arms broken and his tongue bored through with an awl '' before being banished from the settlement entirely . When control of the Virginia Company passed to Sir Edwin Sandys in 1618 , efforts to bring large numbers of settlers to the New World against their will gained traction alongside less coercive measures like indentured servitude . Vagrancy statutes began to provide for penal transportation to the American colonies as an alternative to capital punishment in this period , during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I . At the same time , the legal definition of `` vagrancy '' was greatly expanded . Under Queen Elizabeth I , English vagrancy laws began increasingly to provide for penal transportation as a substitute for capital sentences . Soon , a royal commissions endorsed the notion that any felon -- except those convicted of murder , witchcraft , burglary , or rape -- could legally be transported to Virginia or the West Indies to work as a plantation servant . Sandys also proposed sending maids to Jamestown as `` breeders , '' whose costs of passage could be paid for by the planters who took them on as `` wives . '' Soon , over sixty such women had made the passage to Virginia , and more followed . King James I 's royal administration also sent `` vagrant '' children to the New World as servants . a letter in the Virginia Company 's records suggests that as many as 1,500 children were sent to Virginia between 1619 and 1617 . By 1619 , African prisoners were brought to Jamestown and sold as slaves as well , marking England 's entry into the Atlantic slave trade . The infusion of kidnapped children , maids , convicts , and Africans to Virginia during the early part of the seventeenth century inaugurated a pattern that would continue for nearly two centuries . By 1650 , the majority of British emigrants to colonial North America went as `` prisoners '' of one sort or another -- whether as indentured servants , convict laborers , or slaves . The prisoner trade became the `` moving force '' of English colonial policy after the Restoration -- i.e. , from the summer of 1660 onward -- according to By 1680 , the Reverend Morgan Godwyn estimated that almost 10,000 persons were spirited away to the Americas annually by the English crown . Parliament accelerated the prisoner trade in the eighteenth century . Under England 's Bloody Code , a large portion of the realm 's convicted criminal population faced the death penalty . But pardons were common . During the eighteenth century , the majority of those sentenced to die in English courts were pardoned -- often in exchange for voluntary transport to the colonies . In 1717 , Parliament empowered the English courts to directly sentence offenders to transportation , and by 1769 transportation was the leading punishment for serious crime in Great Britain . Over two - thirds of those sentenced during sessions of the Old Bailey in 1769 were transported . The list of `` serious crimes '' warranting transportation continued to expand throughout the eighteenth century , as it had during the seventeenth . Historian A. Roger Ekirch estimates that as many as one - quarter of all British emigrants to colonial America during the 1700s were convicts . In the 1720s , James Oglethorpe settled the colony of Georgia almost entirely with convict settlers . The typical transported convict during the 1700s was brought to the North American colonies on board a `` prison ship . '' Upon arrival , the convict 's keepers would bathe and clothe him or her ( and , in extreme cases , provide a fresh wig ) in preparation for a convict auction . Newspapers advertised the arrival of a convict cargo in advance , and buyers would come at an appointed hour to purchase convicts off the auction block . The Old Newgate Prison in London was one of many detention centers that facilitated the convict trade between England and its American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries . Prisons played an essential role in the convict trade . Some ancient prisons , like the Fleet and Newgate , still remained in use during the high period of the American prisoner trade in the eighteenth century . But more typically an old house , medieval dungeon space , or private structure would act as a holding pen for those bound for American plantations or the Royal Navy ( under impressment ) . Operating clandestine prisons in major port cities for detainees whose transportation to the New World was not strictly legal , became a lucrative trade on both sides of the Atlantic in this period . Unlike contemporary prisons , those associated with the convict trade served a custodial , not a punitive function . Many colonists in British North America resented convict transportation . As early as 1683 , Pennsylvania 's colonial legislature attempted to bar felons from being introduced within its borders . Benjamin Franklin called convict transportation `` an insult and contempt , the cruellest , that ever one people offered to another . '' Franklin suggested that the colonies send some of North America 's rattlesnakes to England , to be set loose in its finest parks , in revenge . But transportation of convicts to England 's North American colonies continued until the American Revolution , and many officials in England saw it as a humane necessity in light of the harshness of the penal code and contemporary conditions in English jails . Dr. Samuel Johnson , upon hearing that British authorities might bow to continuing agitation in the American colonies against transportation , reportedly told James Boswell : `` Why they are a race of convicts , and ought to be thankful for anything we allow them short of hanging ! '' When the American Revolution ended the prisoner trade to North America , the abrupt halt threw Britain 's penal system into disarray , as prisons and jails quickly filled with the many convicts who previously would have moved on to the colonies . Conditions steadily worsened . It was during this crisis period in the English criminal justice system that penal reformer John Howard began his work . Howard 's comprehensive study of British penal practice , The State of the Prisons in England and Wales , was first published in 1777 -- one year after the start of the Revolution . Colonial criminal punishments , jails , and workhouses ( edit ) The `` Old Gaol ( Jail ) '' in Barnstable , Massachusetts , built in 1690 and operated until 1820 , is today the oldest wooden jail in the United States of America . The jail was built in 1690 by order of Plimouth and Massachusetts Bay Colony Courts . Used as a jail from 1690 -- 1820 ; at one time moved and attached to the Constable 's home . The ' Old Gaol ' was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 . Although jails were an early fixture of colonial North American communities , they generally did not serve as places of incarceration as a form of criminal punishment . Instead , the main role of the colonial American jail was as a non-punitive detention facility for pre-trial and pre-sentence criminal defendants , as well as imprisoned debtors . The most common penal sanctions of the day were fines , whipping , and community - oriented punishments like the stocks . Jails were among the earliest public structures built in colonial British North America . The 1629 colonial charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , for example , granted the shareholders behind the venture the right to establish laws for their settlement `` not contrarie to the lawes of our realm in England '' and to administer `` lawfull correction '' to violators , and Massachusetts established a house of correction for punishing criminals by 1635 . Colonial Pennsylvania built two houses of correction starting in 1682 , and Connecticut established one in 1727 . By the eighteenth century , every county in the North American colonies had a jail . A whipping post or pillory , with stocks atop it , at the New Castle County Jail , Delaware , in 1897 . Colonial American jails were not the `` ordinary mechanism of correction '' for criminal offenders , according to social historian David Rothman . Criminal incarceration as a penal sanction was `` plainly a second choice , '' either a supplement to or a substitute for traditional criminal punishments of the day , in the words of historian Adam J. Hirsch . Eighteenth - century criminal codes provided for a far wider range of criminal punishments than contemporary state and federal criminal laws in the United States . Fines , whippings , the stocks , the pillory , the public cage , banishment , capital punishment at the gallows , penal servitude in private homes -- all of these punishments came before imprisonment in British colonial America . The most common sentence of the colonial era was a fine or a whipping , but the stocks were another common punishment -- so much so that most colonies , like Virginia in 1662 , hastened to build these before either the courthouse or the jail . The theocratic communities of Puritan Massachusetts imposed faith - based punishments like the admonition -- a formal censure , apology , and pronouncement of criminal sentence ( generally reduced or suspended ) , performed in front of the church - going community . Sentences to the colonial American workhouse -- when they were actually imposed on defendants -- rarely exceeded three months , and sometimes spanned just a single day . Colonial jails served a variety of public functions other than penal imprisonment . Civil imprisonment for debt was one of these , but colonial jails also served as warehouses for prisoners - of - war and political prisoners ( especially during the American Revolution ) . They were also an integral part of the transportation and slavery systems -- not only as warehouses for convicts and slaves being put up for auction , but also as a means of disciplining both kinds of servants . Depiction of slaves -- another labor force brought to England 's American colonies in captivity -- processing tobacco in 17th - century Virginia . The colonial jail 's primary criminal law function was as a pre-trial and pre-sentence detention facility . Generally , only the poorest or most despised defendants found their way into the jails of colonial North America , since colonial judges rarely denied requests for bail . The only penal function of significance that colonial jails served was for contempt -- but this was a coercive technique designed to protect the power of the courts , not a penal sanction in its own right . The colonial jail differed from today 's United States prisons not only in its purpose , but in its structure . Many were no more than a cage or closet . Colonial jailers ran their institutions on a `` familial '' model and resided in an apartment attached to the jail , sometimes with a family of their own . The colonial jail 's design resembled an ordinary domestic residence , and inmates essentially rented their bed and paid the jailer for necessities . Before the close of the American Revolution , few statutes or regulations defined the colonial jailers ' duty of care or other responsibilities . Upkeep was often haphazard , and escapes quite common . Few official efforts were made to maintain inmates ' health or see to their other basic needs . Post-revolutionary penal reform and the beginnings of United States prison systems ( edit ) A map of Philadelphia in 1796 , at a time when a century of population growth and social change was beginning to transform crime and punishment in the city and elsewhere in the early United States . The first major prison reform movement in the United States came after the American Revolution , at the start of the nineteenth century . According to historians Adam J. Hirsch and David Rothman , the reform of this period was shaped less by intellectual movements in England than by a general clamor for action in a time of population growth and increasing social mobility , which prompted a critical reappraisal and revision of penal corrective techniques . To address these changes , post-colonial legislators and reformers began to stress the need for a system of hard labor to replace ineffectual corporal and traditional punishments . Ultimately , these early efforts yielded the United States ' first penitentiary systems . The onset of the eighteenth century brought major demographic and social change to colonial and , eventually post-colonial American life . The century was marked by rapid population growth throughout the colonies -- a result of lower mortality rates and increasing ( though small at first ) rates of immigration . In the aftermath of the Revolutionary War , this trend persisted . Between 1790 and 1830 , the population of the newly independent North American states greatly increased , and the number and density of urban centers did as well . The population of Massachusetts almost doubled in this period , while it tripled in Pennsylvania and increased five-fold in New York . In 1790 , no American city had more than fifty thousand residents ; however , by 1830 nearly 500,000 people lived in cities larger than that . The population of the former British colonies also became increasingly mobile during the eighteenth century , especially after the Revolution . Movement to urban centers , in and out of emerging territories , and up and down a more fluid social ladder throughout the century made it difficult for the localism and hierarchy that had structured American life in the seventeenth century to retain their former significance . The Revolution only accelerated patterns of dislocation and transience , leaving displaced families and former soldiers struggling to adapt to the strictures of a stunted post-war economy . The emergence of cities created a kind of community very different from the pre-revolutionary model . The crowded streets of emerging urban centers like Philadelphia seemed to contemporary observers to dangerously blur class , sex , and racial boundaries . William Bradford , like other commentators of the post-revolutionary period , believed that the harsh punishments of English criminal law had perpetuated crime in the North American colonies . Demographic change in the eighteenth century coincided with shifts in the configuration of crime . After 1700 , literary evidence from a variety of sources -- e.g. , ministers , newspapers , and judges -- suggest that property crime rates rose ( or , at least , were perceived to ) . Conviction rates appear to have risen during the last half of the eighteenth century , rapidly so in the 1770s and afterward and especially in urban areas . Contemporary accounts also suggest widespread transiency among former criminals . Communities began to think about their town as something less than the sum of all its inhabitants during this period , and the notion of a distinct criminal class began to materialize . In the Philadelphia of the 1780s , for example , city authorities worried about the proliferation of taverns on the outskirts of the city , `` sites of an alternative , interracial , lower - class culture '' that was , in the words of one observer , `` the very root of vice . '' In Boston , a higher urban crime rate led to the creation of a specialized , urban court in 1800 . The efficacy of traditional , community - based punishments waned during the eighteenth century . Penal servitude , a mainstay of British and colonial American criminal justice , became nearly extinct during the seventeenth century , at the same time that Northern states , beginning with Vermont in 1777 , began to abolish slavery . Fines and bonds for good behavior -- one of the most common criminal sentences of the colonial era -- were nearly impossible to enforce among the transient poor . As the former American colonists expanded their political loyalty beyond the parochial to their new state governments , promoting a broader sense of the public welfare , banishment ( or `` warning out '' ) also seemed inappropriate , since it merely passed criminals onto a neighboring community . Public shaming punishments like the pillory had always been inherently unstable methods of enforcing the public order , since they depended in large part on the participation of the accused and the public . As the eighteenth century matured , and a social distance between the criminal and the community became more manifest , mutual antipathy ( rather than community compassion and offender penitence ) became more common at public executions and other punishments . In urban centers like Philadelphia , growing class and racial tensions -- especially in the wake of the Revolution -- led crowds to actively sympathize with the accused at executions and other public punishments . Colonial governments began making efforts to reform their penal architecture and excise many traditional punishments even before the Revolution . Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , and Connecticut all inaugurated efforts to reconstitute their penal systems in the years leading up to the war to make incarceration at hard labor the sole punishment for most crimes . Although war interrupted these efforts , they were renewed afterward . A `` climate change '' in post-Revolutionary politics , in the words of historian Adam J. Hirsch , made colonial legislatures open to legal change of all sorts after the Revolution , as they retooled their constitutions and criminal codes to reflect their separation from England . The Anglophobic politics of the day bolstered efforts to do away with punishments inherited from English legal practice . An artist 's 1840 depiction of Massachusetts ' Charlestown State Prison , opened in 1805 to accommodate the state 's increasing prison population due to post-revolutionary penal reforms . Reformers in the United States also began to discuss the effect of criminal punishment itself on criminality in the post-revolutionary period , and at least some concluded that the barbarism of colonial - era punishments , inherited from English penal practice , did more harm than good . `` The mild voice of reason and humanity , '' wrote New York penal reformer Thomas Eddy in 1801 , `` reached not the thrones of princes or the halls of legislators . '' `` The mother country had stifled the colonists ' benevolent instincts , '' according to Eddy , `` compelling them to emulate the crude customs of the old world . The result was the predominance of archaic and punitive laws that only served to perpetuate crime . '' Attorney William Bradford made an argument similar to Eddy 's in a 1793 treatise . By the second decade of the nineteenth century every state except North Carolina , South Carolina , and Florida had amended its criminal code to provide for incarceration ( primarily at hard labor ) as the primary punishment for all but the most serious offenses . Provincial laws in Massachusetts began to prescribe short terms in the workhouse for deterrence throughout the eighteenth century and , by mid-century , the first statutes mandating long - term hard labor in the workhouse as a penal sanction appeared . In New York , a 1785 bill , restricted in effect to New York City , authorized municipal officials to substitute up to six months ' hard labor in the workhouse in all cases where prior law had mandated corporal punishment . In 1796 , an additional bill expanded this program to the entire state of New York . Pennsylvania established a hard labor law in 1786 . Hard - labor programs expanded to New Jersey in 1797 , to Virginia in 1796 , to Kentucky in 1798 , and to Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maryland in 1800 . This move toward imprisonment did not translate to an immediate break from traditional forms of punishment . Many new criminal provisions merely expanded the discretion of judges to choose from among various punishments , including imprisonment . The 1785 amendments to Massachusetts ' arson statute , for instance , expanded the available punishments for setting fire to a non-dwelling from whipping to hard labor , imprisonment in jail , the pillory , whipping , fining , or any or all of those punishments in combination . Massachusetts judges wielded this new - found discretion in various ways for twenty years , before fines , incarceration , or the death penalty became the sole available sanctions under the state 's penal code . Other states -- e.g. , New York , Pennsylvania , and Connecticut -- also lagged in their shift toward incarceration . Prison construction kept pace with post-revolutionary legal change . All states that revised their criminal codes to provide for incarceration also constructed new state prisons . But the focus of penal reformers in the post-revolutionary years remained largely external to the institutions they built , according to David Rothman . For reformers of the day , Rothman claims , the fact of imprisonment -- not the institution 's internal routine and its effect on the offender -- was of primary concern . Incarceration seemed more humane than traditional punishments like hanging and whipping , and it theoretically matched punishment more specifically to the crime . But it would take another period of reform , in the Jacksonian Era , for state prison initiatives to take the shape of actual justice institutions . Jacksonian and antebellum Era ( edit ) Present - day exterior shot of the gate at Eastern State Penitentiary , birthplace of the `` Pennsylvania ( or Separate ) System '' of prison governance . By 1800 , eleven of the then - sixteen United States -- i.e. , Pennsylvania , New York , New Jersey , Massachusetts , Kentucky , Vermont , Maryland , New Hampshire , Georgia , and Virginia -- had in place some form of penal incarceration . But the primary focus of contemporary criminology remained on the legal system , according to historian David Rothman , not the institutions in which convicts served their sentences . This changed during the Jacksonian Era , as contemporary notions of criminality continued to shift . Starting in the 1820s , a new institution , the `` penitentiary '' , gradually became the focal point of criminal justice in the United States . At the same time , other novel institutions -- the asylum and the almshouse -- redefined care for the mentally ill and the poor . For its proponents , the penitentiary was an ambitious program whose external appearance , internal arrangements , and daily routine would counteract the disorder and immorality thought to be breeding crime in American society . Although its adoption was haphazard at first , and marked by political strife -- especially in the South -- the penitentiary became an established institution in the United States by the end of the 1830s . New origins of deviancy and an institutional response ( edit ) Francis Wayland , a Baptist reformer of the antebellum period , advocated for the `` Auburn ( or Congregate ) System '' . Jacksonian - era reformers and prison officials began seeking the origins of crime in the personal histories of criminals and traced the roots of crime to society itself . In the words of historian David Rothman , `` They were certain that children lacking discipline quickly fell victim to the influence of vice at loose in the community . '' Jacksonian reformers specifically tied rapid population growth and social mobility to the disorder and immorality of contemporary society . To combat society 's decay and the risks presented by it , Jacksonian penologists designed an institutional setting to remove `` deviants '' from the corruption of their families and communities . In this corruption - free environment , the deviant could learn the vital moral lessons he or she had previously ignored while sheltered from the temptations of vice . This solution ultimately took the shape of the penitentiary . In the 1820s , New York and Pennsylvania began new prison initiatives that inspired similar efforts in a number of other states . Post-revolutionary carceral regimes had conformed to the English workhouse tradition ; inmates labored together by day and shared congregate quarters at night . Antebellum reformer Dorothea Dix supported the `` Pennsylvania ( or Separate ) System '' . Beginning in 1790 , Pennsylvania became the first of the United States to institute solitary confinement for incarcerated convicts . After 1790 , those sentenced to hard labor in Pennsylvania were moved indoors to an inner block of solitary cells in Philadelphia 's Walnut Street Jail . New York began implementing solitary living quarters at New York City 's Newgate Prison in 1796 . From the efforts at the Walnut Street Jail and Newgate Prison , two competing systems of imprisonment emerged in the United States by the 1820s . The `` Auburn '' ( or `` Congregate System '' ) emerged from New York 's prison of the same name between 1819 and 1823 . And the `` Pennsylvania '' ( or `` Separate System '' ) emerged in that state between 1826 and 1829 . The only material difference between the two systems was whether inmates would ever leave their solitary cells -- under the Pennsylvania System , inmates almost never did , but under the Auburn System most inmates labored in congregate workshops by day and slept alone . To advocates of both systems , the promise of institutionalization depended upon isolating the prisoner from the moral contamination of society and establishing discipline in him ( or , in rarer cases , her ) . But the debate as to which system was superior continued into the mid-nineteenth century , pitting some of the period 's most prominent reformers against one another . Samuel Gridley Howe promoted the Pennsylvania System in opposition to Matthew Carey , an Auburn proponent ; Dorothea Dix took up the Pennsylvania System against Louis Dwight ; and Francis Lieber supported Pennsylvania against Francis Wayland . The Auburn system eventually prevailed , however , due largely to its lesser cost . The Pennsylvania system ( edit ) See also : Separate system Present - day photograph of a typical cell at the Eastern State Penitentiary , where the `` Pennsylvania ( or Separate ) System '' was first practiced , in restored condition . The Pennsylvania system , first implemented in the early 1830s at that state 's Eastern State Penitentiary outskirts of Philadelphia and Western State Penitentiary at Pittsburgh , was designed to maintain the complete separation of inmates at all times . Until 1904 , prisoners entered the institution with a black hood over their head , so they would never know who their fellow convicts were , before being led to the cell where they would serve the remainder of their sentence in near - constant solitude . The Cherry Hill complex entailed a massive expenditure of state funds ; its walls alone cost $200,000 , and its final price tag reached $750,000 , one of the largest state expenditures of its day . Like its competitor Auburn system , Eastern State 's regimen was premised on the inmate 's potential for individual rehabilitation . Solitude , not labor , was its hallmark ; labor was reserved only for those inmates who affirmatively earned the privilege . All contact with the outside world more or less ceased for Eastern State prisoners . Proponents boasted that a Pennsylvania inmate was `` perfectly secluded from the world ... hopelessly separated from ... family , and from all communication with and knowledge of them for the whole term of imprisonment . '' Samuel Gridley Howe , antebellum American reformer and advocate for the `` Pennsylvania ( or Separate ) System '' of prison governance . Through isolation and silence -- complete separation from the moral contaminants of the outside worlds -- Pennsylvania supporters surmised that inmates would begin a reformation . `` Each individual , '' a representative tract reads , `` will necessarily be made the instrument of his own punishment ; his conscience will be the avenger of society . '' Proponents insisted that the Pennsylvania system would involve only mild disciplinary measures , reasoning that isolated men would have neither the resources nor the occasion to violate rules or to escape . But from the outset Eastern State 's keepers used corporal punishments to enforce order . Officials used the `` iron gag , '' a bridle - like metal bit placed in the inmate 's mouth and chained around his neck and head ; the `` shower bath , '' repeated dumping of cold water onto a restrained convict ; or the `` mad chair , '' into which inmates were strapped in such a way so as to prevent their bodies from resting . Ultimately , only three prisons ever enacted the costly Pennsylvania program . But nearly all penal reformers of the antebellum period believed in Pennsylvania 's use of solitary confinement . The system remained largely intact at Eastern State Penitentiary into the early twentieth century . New York , the Auburn system , and the future of the penitentiary ( edit ) See also : Auburn system Elam Lynds , the first warden of the Auburn Penitentiary , is credited with creating the `` Auburn ( or Congregate ) System . '' The Auburn or `` Congregate '' System became the archetypical model penitentiary in the 1830s and 1840s , as its use expanded from New York 's Auburn Penitentiary into the Northeast , the Midwest , and the South . The Auburn system 's combination of congregate labor in prison workshops and solitary confinement by night became a near - universal ideal in United States prison systems , if not an actual reality . Under the Auburn system , prisoners slept alone at night and labored together in a congregate workshop during the day for the entirety of their fixed criminal sentence as set by a judge . Prisoners at Auburn were not to converse at any time , or even to exchange glances . Guards patrolled secret passageways behind the walls of the prison 's workshops in moccasins , so inmates could never be sure whether or not they were under surveillance . One official described Auburn 's discipline as `` tak ( ing ) measures for convincing the felon that he is no longer his own master ; no longer in a condition to practice deceptions in idleness ; that he must learn and practice diligently some useful trade , whereby , when he is let out of the prison to obtain an honest living . '' Inmates were permitted no intelligence of events on the outside . In the words of an early warden , Auburn inmates were `` to be literally buried from the world . '' The institution 's regime remained largely intact until after the Civil War . An 1855 engraving of New York 's Sing Sing Penitentiary , which also followed the `` Auburn ( or Congregate ) System . '' Auburn was the second state prison built in New York State . The first , Newgate , located in present - day Greenwich Village in New York City , contained no solitary cells beyond a few set aside for `` worst offenders . '' Its first keeper , Quaker Thomas Eddy , believed rehabilitation of the criminal was the primary end of punishment ( though Eddy also believed that his charges were `` wicked and depraved , capable of every atrocity , and ever plotting some means of violence and escape . '' ) Eddy was not inclined to rely on prisoners ' fear of his severity ; his `` chief disciplinary weapon '' was solitary confinement on limited rations , he forbade his guards from striking inmates , and permitted `` well - behaved '' inmates to have a supervised visit with family once every three months . Eddy made largely unsuccessful efforts to establish profitable prison labor programs , which he had hoped would cover incarceration costs and provide seed money for inmates ' re-entry into society in the form of the `` overstint '' -- i.e. , a small portion of the profits of an inmate 's labor while incarcerated , payable at his or her release . Discipline nevertheless remained hard to enforce , and major riots occurred in 1799 and 1800 -- the latter only subdued via military intervention . Conditions continued to worsen in the wake of the riots , especially during a crime wave that followed the War of 1812 . Present - day photograph of a cell in the older facility at Sing Sing Penitentiary . New York legislators set aside funds for construction of the Auburn prison to address the disappointments of Newgate and alleviate its persistent overcrowding . Almost from the outset , Auburn officials , with the consent of the legislature , eschewed the `` humane '' style envisioned by Thomas Eddy for Newgate . Floggings of up to thirty - nine lashes in duration as punishment for disciplinary infractions were permitted under an 1819 state law , which also authorized the use of the stocks and the irons . The practice of providing convicts with some of the proceeds of their labor at the time of release , the `` overstint , '' was discontinued . The severity of the new regime likely caused another series of riots in 1820 , after which the legislature formed a New York State Prison Guard for putting down future disturbances . Officials also began implementing a classification system at Auburn in the wake of the riots , dividing inmates into three groups : ( 1 ) the worst , who were placed on constant solitary lockdown ; ( 2 ) middling offenders , who were kept in solitary and worked in groups when well - behaved ; and ( 3 ) the `` least guilty and depraved , '' who were permitted to sleep in solitary and work in groups . Construction on a new solitary cell block for category ( 1 ) inmates ended in December 1821 , after which these `` hardened '' offenders moved into their new home . Within a little over a year , however , five of these men had died of consumption , another forty - one were seriously ill , and several had gone insane . After visiting the prison and seeing the residents of the new cell block , Governor Joseph C. Yates was so appalled by their condition that he pardoned several of them outright . When Joseph C. Yates visited solitary cells at the Auburn Penitentiary in the early 1820s , he pardoned several inmates on the spot to spare them further confinement at the prison . Scandal struck Auburn again when a female inmate became pregnant in solitary confinement and , later , died after repeated beatings and the onset of pneumonia . ( Because Auburn relied on female inmates for its washing and cleaning services , women remained part of the population but the first separate women 's institution in New York was not completed until 1893 . ) A jury convicted the keeper who beat the woman of assault and battery , and fined him $25 , but he remained on the job . A grand jury investigation into other aspects of the prison 's management followed but was hampered , among other obstacles , by the fact that convicts could not present evidence in court . Even so , the grand jury eventually concluded that Auburn 's keepers had been permitted to flog inmates without a higher official present , a violation of state law . But neither the warden nor any other officer was ever prosecuted , and the use and intensity of flogging only increased at Auburn , as well as the newer Sing Sing prison , in subsequent years . Despite its early scandals and regular political power struggles that left it with an unstable administrative structure , Auburn remained a model institution nationwide for decades to come . Massachusetts opened a new prison in 1826 modeled on the Auburn system , and within the first decade of Auburn 's existence , New Hampshire , Vermont , Maryland , Kentucky , Ohio , Tennessee , and the District of Columbia all constructed prisons patterned on its congregate system . By the eve of the American Civil War , Illinois , Indiana , Georgia , Missouri , Mississippi , Texas , and Arkansas , with varying success , had all inaugurated efforts to establish an Auburn - model prison in their jurisdictions . The widespread move to penitentiaries in the antebellum United States changed the geography of criminal punishment , as well as its central therapy . Offenders were now ferried across water or into walled compounds to centralized institutions of the criminal justice system hidden from public view . The penitentiary thus largely ended community involvement in the penal process -- beyond a limited role in the criminal trial itself -- though many prisons permitted visitors who paid a fee to view the inmates throughout the nineteenth century . The South ( edit ) On eve of American Civil War , crime did not pose a major concern in the Southern United States . Southerners in the main considered crime to be a Northern problem . A traditional extra-legal system of remedying slights , based in honor culture made personal violence the hallmark of Southern crime . Southern penitentiary systems brought only the most hardened criminals under centralized state control . Most criminals remained outside of formal state control structures -- especially outside of Southern cities . Antebellum Southern republicanism and political opposition to penitentiary building ( edit ) The historical record suggests that , in contrast to Northerners , Southernern states experienced a unique political anxiety about whether to construct prisons during the antebellum period . Disagreements over republican principles -- i.e. , the role of the state in social governance -- became the focus of a persistent debate about the necessity of southern penitentiaries in the decades between independence and the Civil War . To many Southerners , writes historian Edward L. Ayers , `` republicanism '' translated simply to freedom from the will of anyone else : Centralized power , even in the name of an activist republican government , promised more evil than good . Ayers concludes that this form of Southern republicanism owed its particular shape to slavery . The South 's slave economy perpetuated a rural , localized culture , he argues , in which men distrusted strangers ' claims to power . In this political milieu , the notion of surrendering individual liberties of any kind -- even those of criminals -- for some abstract conception of `` social improvement '' was abhorrent to many . But criminal incarceration appealed to others in the South . These Southerners believed that freedom would best grow under the protection of an enlightened state government that made the criminal law more effective by eradicating its more brutal practices and offering criminals the possibility of rehabilitation and restoration to society . Some also believed that penitentiaries would help to remove the contagion of depravity from republican society by segregating those who threatened the republican ideal ( the `` disturbing class '' ) . Notions of living up to the world 's ideas of `` progress '' also animated Southern penal reformers . When the Georgia legislature considered abolishing the state 's penitentiary after a devastating fire in 1829 , reformers there worried their state would become the first to renounce republican `` progress . '' A sizable portion of the Southern population -- if not the majority -- did not support the establishment of the penitentiary . Of the two times that voters in the region had an opportunity to express their opinion of the penitentiary system at the ballot box -- in Alabama and North Carolina -- the penitentiary lost overwhelmingly . Some viewed traditional public punishments as the most republican mechanism for criminal justice , due to their inherent transparency . Some worried that , since the quantity of suffering under penitentiary system would sure to far exceed that of the traditional system , Southern jurors would maintain their historic disposal toward acquittal . Evangelical Southern clergymen also opposed the penitentiary -- especially when its implementation accompanied statutory restriction of the death penalty , which they deemed a biblical requirement for certain crimes . Opposition to the penitentiary crossed party lines ; neither the Whigs nor the Democrats lent consistent support to the institution in the antebellum period . But consistent and enthusiastic support for the penitentiary did come , almost uniformly , from Southern governors . The motives of these governors are note entirely unclear , historian Edward L. Ayers concludes : Perhaps they hoped that the additional patronage positions offered by a penitentiary would augment the historically weak power of the Southern executive ; perhaps they were legitimately concerned with the problem of crime ; or perhaps both considerations played a role . Grand juries -- drawn from Southern `` elites '' -- also issued regular calls for penitentiaries in this period . Ultimately , the penitentiary 's supporters prevailed in the South , as in the North . Southern legislators enacted prison legislation in state after Southern state before the Civil War , often over public opposition . Their motives in doing so appear mixed . According to Edward L. Ayers , some Southern legislators appear to have believed they knew what was best for their people in any case . Since many Southern legislators came from the elite classes , Ayers also observes , they may also have had a personal `` class control '' motive for enacting penitentiary legislation , even while they could point to their participation in penitentiary efforts as evidence of their own benevolence . Historian Michael S. Hindus concludes that Southern hesitation about the penitentiary , at least in South Carolina , stemmed from the slave system , which made the creation of a white criminal underclass undesirable . Prison construction ( edit ) Southern states erected penitentiaries alongside their Northern counterparts in the early nineteenth century . Virginia ( 1796 ) , Maryland ( 1829 ) , Tennessee ( 1831 ) , Georgia ( 1832 ) , Louisiana and Missouri ( 1834 -- 1837 ) , and Mississippi and Alabama ( 1837 -- 1842 ) all erected penitentiary facilities during the antebellum period . Only the North Carolina , South Carolina and largely uninhabited Florida failed to build any penitentiary before the Civil War Virginia was the first state after Pennsylvania , in 1796 , to dramatically reduce the number of crimes punishable by death , and its legislators simultaneously called for the construction of a `` gaol and penitentiary house '' as the cornerstone of a new criminal justice regime . Designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe , the state 's first prison at Richmond resembled Jeremy Bentham 's Panopticon design ( as well as the not - yet - built Eastern State Penitentiary 's ) . All inmates served a mandatory period of solitary confinement after initial entry . Unfortunately for its inhabitants , the site at Richmond where Virginia 's first penitentiary was built bordered a stagnant pool , in which sewage collected . The prison 's cells had no heating system and water oozed from its walls , leading inmates ' extremities to freeze during the winter months . Prisoners could perform no work during the solitary portion of their sentence , which they served completely isolated in near - total darkness , and many went mad during this portion of their sentence . Those prisoners who survived the isolation period joined other inmates in the prison workshop to make goods for the state militia . The workshop never turned a profit . Escapes were common . But despite Virginia 's example , Kentucky , Maryland , and Georgia all constructed prisons before 1820 , and the trend continued in the South thereafter . Early Southern prisons were marked by escapes , violence , and arson . The personal reformation of inmates was left almost solely to underpaid prison chaplains . Bitter opposition from the public and rampant overcrowding both marked Southern penal systems during the antebellum period . But once established , southern penitentiaries took on lives of their own , with each state 's system experiencing a complex history of innovation and stagnation , efficient and inefficient wardens , relative prosperity and poverty , fires , escapes , and legislative attacks ; but they did follow a common trajectory . During the period in which slavery existed , few black Southerners in the lower South were imprisoned , and virtually none of those imprisoned were slaves . Most often , slaves accused of crimes -- especially less serious offenses -- were tried informally in extra-legal plantation `` courts , '' although it was not uncommon for slaves to come within the formal jurisdiction of the Southern courts . The majority of Southern inmates during the antebellum period were foreign - born whites . Nevertheless , in the upper South , free blacks made up a significant ( and disproportionate ) one - third of state prison populations . Governors and legislators in both the upper and lower South became concerned about racial mixing in their prison systems . Virginia experimented for a time with selling free blacks convicted of `` serious '' crimes into slavery until public opposition led to the measure 's repeal ( but only after forty such persons were sold ) . Very few women , black or white , were imprisoned in the antebellum South . But for those women who did come under the control of Southern prisons , conditions were often `` horrendous , '' according to Edward L. Ayers . Although they were not made to shave their heads like male convicts , female inmates in the antebellum South did not live in specialized facilities -- as was the case in many antebellum Northern prisons -- and sexual abuse was common . As in the North , the costs of imprisonment preoccupied Southern authorities , although it appears that Southerners devoted more concern to this problem than their Northern counterparts . Southern governors of the antebellum period tended to have little patience for prisons that did not turn a profit or , at least , break even . Southern prisons adopted many of the same money - making tactics as their Northern counterparts . Prisons earned money by charging fees to visitors . They also earned money by harnessing convict labor to produce simple goods that were in steady demand , like slave shoes , wagons , pails , and bricks . But this fomented unrest among workers and tradesmen in Southern towns and cities . Governor Andrew Johnson of Tennessee , a former tailor , waged political war on his state 's penitentiary and the industries it had introduced among its inmates . To avoid these conflicts , some states -- like Georgia and Mississippi -- experimented with prison industry for state - run enterprises . But in the end few penitentiaries , North or South , turned a profit during the antebellum period . Presaging Reconstruction - era developments , however , Virginia , Georgia , and Tennessee began considering the idea of leasing their convicts to private businesspersons by the 1850s . Prisoners in Missouri , Alabama , Texas , Kentucky , and Louisiana all leased their convicts during the antebellum period under a variety of arrangements -- some inside the prison itself ( as Northern prisons were also doing ) , and others outside of the state 's own facilities . Urban crime in the antebellum South ( edit ) Between 1800 and 1860 , the vast majority of the Southern population worked in agriculture . Whereas the proportion of the Northern population working on farms dropped in this period from 70 to 40 percent , 80 percent of Southerners were consistently engaged in farm - related work . Reflecting this , only one - tenth of Southerners lived in what the contemporary census criteria described as an urban area ( compared to nearly one - quarter of Northerners ) . Antebellum southern cities stood at juncture of the region 's slave economy and the international market economy , and economics appear to have played crucial role in shaping the face of crime in Southern cities . These urban centers tended to attract young and propertyless white males , not only from the Southern countryside , but also from the North and abroad . Urban immigration in the South reached a peak during the 1850s , when an economic boom in cotton produced `` flush times . '' Poor young men and others -- white and black -- settled on the peripheries of Southern cities like Savannah , Georgia . Here they came into contact with the wealthy and more stable elements of modern society , producing demographics similar to those in post-revolutionary Philadelphia and other Northern cities . The first modern Southern police forces emerged between 1845 and the Civil War in large part due to the class - based tensions that developed in Southern cities . Some Southern cities -- notably New Orleans and Charleston -- experimented with police forces even earlier in the eighteenth century as a means of controlling their large urban slave populations . But most Southern cities relied on volunteer night - watch forces prior to mid-century . The transition to uniformed police forces was not especially smooth : Major political opposition arose as a result of the perceived corruption , inefficiency , and threat to individual liberty posed by the new police . According to Edward L. Ayers , Southern police forces of the antebellum period tended to enforce uniformity by creating crime out of `` disorder '' and `` nuisance '' enforcement . The vast majority of theft prosecutions in the antebellum South arose in its cities . And property offenders made up a disproportionate share of the convict population . Although thieves and burglars constituted fewer than 20 percent of the criminals convicted in Southern courts , they made up about half the South 's prison population . During the period between independence and the Civil War , Southern inmates were disproportionately ethnic . Foreign - born persons made up less than 3 percent of the South 's free population . In fact , only one - eighth of all immigrants to the United States during the antebellum period settled in the South . Yet foreign immigrants represented anywhere from 8 to 37 percent of the prison population of the Southern states during this period . Crime in Southern cities generally mirrored that of Northern ones during the antebellum years . Both sections experienced a spike in imprisonment rates during a national market depression on the eve of the American Civil War . The North had experienced a similar depression during the 1830s and 1840s -- with a concurrent increase in imprisonment -- that the agrarian South did not . But urban crime in the South differed from that in the North in one key way -- its violence . A significantly higher percentage of violence characterized Southern criminal offenders of all class levels . Young white males made up the bulk of violent offenders in the urban South . Slavery in the urban South also played a role in the development of its penal institutions . Urban slave - owners often utilized jails to `` store '' their human property and to punish slaves for disciplinary infractions . Slaveholding in urban areas tended to be less rigid than in the rural South . Nearly 60 percent of slaves living in Savannah , Georgia , for example , did not reside with their master ; many were allowed to hire themselves out for wages ( though they had to share the proceeds with their owner ) . In this environment , where racial control was more difficult to enforce , Southern whites were constantly on guard against black criminality . Charleston , South Carolina , established a specialized workhouse for masters to send their slaves for punishment for a fee . In Savannah , Georgia , owners could send their slaves to the city jail to have punishment administered . Rural crime in the antebellum South ( edit ) Industrialization proceeded haphazardly across the South during the antebellum period , and large sections of the rural population participated in a subsistence economy like that of the colonial era . Patterns of crime in these regions reflected these economic realities ; violence , not thefts , took up most of the docket space in rural Southern courts . Unlike antebellum urban spaces , the ups and downs of the market economy had a lesser impact on crime in the South 's rural areas . Far fewer theft cases appear on criminal dockets in the rural antebellum South than in its cities ( though rural judges and juries , like their urban counterparts , dealt with property offenders more harshly than violent ones ) . Crime in rural area areas consisted almost solely of violent offenses . Most counties in the antebellum South -- as in the North -- maintained a jail for housing pre-trial and pre-sentence detainees . These varied in size and quality of construction considerably as a result of disparities in wealth between various counties . Unlike Southern cities , however , rural counties rarely used the jail as criminal punishment in the antebellum period , even as states across the Northeast and the Midwest shifted the focus of their criminal justice process to rehabilitative incarceration . Instead , fines were the mainstay of rural Southern justice . The non-use of imprisonment as a criminal punishment in the rural antebellum South reflected the haphazard administration of criminal justice in these regions . Under the general criminal procedure of the day , victims of theft or violence swore out complaints before their local justice of the peace , who in turn issued arrest warrants for the accused . The county sheriff would execute the warrant and bring the defendant before a magistrate judge , who would conduct a preliminary hearing , after which he could either dismiss the case or bind the accused over to the Superior Court for a grand jury hearing . ( Some cases , however , particularly those involving moral offenses like drinking and gambling , were initiated by the grand jury of its own accord . ) Criminal procedure in the antebellum rural South offered many avenues of escape to a criminal defendant , and only the poorest resided in the jail while awaiting trial or sentencing . Those defendants who did spend time in jail before trial had to wait for the prosecutor 's biannual visit to their county . Southern prosecutors generally did not live in the local area where they prosecuted cases and were generally ill - prepared . Disinterested jurors were also hard to come by , given the generally intimate nature of rural Southern communities . Relative leniency in sentencing for appears to have marked most judicial proceedings for violent offenses -- the most common . Historical evidence suggests that juries indicted a greater number of potential offenders than the judicial system could handle in the belief that many troublemakers -- especially the landless -- would leave the country altogether . Few immigrants or free blacks lived in the rural South in the pre-Civil War years , and slaves remained under the dominant control of a separate criminal justice system administered by planters throughout the period . Thus , most criminal defendants were Southern - born whites ( and all socio - economic classes were represented on criminal dockets ) . Blacks occasionally came within the purview of the conventional criminal justice apparatus from their dealings with whites in the `` gray market , '' among other offenses . But the danger to whites and blacks alike from illicit trading , the violence that often erupted at their meetings , and the tendency of whites to take advantage of their legally impotent black counterparties all made these occurrences relatively rare . Reconstruction Era ( edit ) The American Civil War and its aftermath witnessed renewed efforts to reform America 's system and rationale for imprisonment . Most state prisons remained unchanged since the wave of penitentiary building during the Jacksonian Era and , as a result , were in a state of physical and administrative deterioration . Auburn and Eastern State penitentiaries , the paradigmatic prisons of Jacksonian reform , were little different . New reformers confronted the problems of decaying antebellum prisons with a new penal regime that focused on the rehabilitation of the individual -- this time with an emphasis on using institutional inducements as a means of affecting behavioral change . At the same time , Reconstruction - era penology also focused on emerging `` scientific '' views of criminality related to race and heredity , as the post-war years witnessed the birth of a eugenics movement in the United States . Northern developments ( edit ) Brutality , immigration , eugenics , and `` prisons as laboratories '' ( edit ) Social historian David Rothman describes the story of post-reconstruction prison administration as one of decline from the ambitions Jacksonian period . Facing major overcrowding and understaffing issues , prison officials reverted to `` amazingly bizarre '' methods of controlling their charges , Rothman writes . Among the punishments that proliferated in this period were : The Pulley or Tying Up -- Convicts were suspended by the wrists , fastened over their head , for anywhere from a few minutes to an hour . At Sing Sing Prison , where this treatment was especially popular a New York investigator related , `` Men have been kept raised so long as to cause bleeding from the mouth , before the doctor would order the prisoner taken down . '' Wardens also used a variation on the pulley known as the `` hooks , '' which involved tying the inmates ' hands together and lashing them to the wall at chest height , forcing them to put most of their weight onto their toes . The Iron Cap or `` Cage '' -- The convict wore a case composed of small rods or bands of iron -- which weighed between 6 1\u20442 and 8 pounds -- around the neck , and an iron band across the next and shoulders held it in place . The Lash and Paddle -- This traditional penitentiary punishment continued into the post-war era with some refinement -- i.e. , weighted leather strips and aerated paddles were used instead of whips . The number of strokes was set to the offense and in some placed , like Massachusetts , limited by statute . Sing Sing convicts in the 1880s reportedly jumped from the upper galleries of the prison 's cell blocks in an effort to break their legs and escape a paddling . Solitary Confinement ( `` The Dungeon '' ) -- Reconstruction - era inmates were locked in dark solitary cells , furnished only with a bucket , and fed short rations for disciplinary infractions ( usually for a period of up to a week , but sometimes up to six or more ) . Straitjackets -- Wardens used these as much for discipline as for inmate safety . Brickbag -- Convicts who would not work were forced in some institutions to wear a heavy bag ( full of weighted objects ) . Water Crib -- Used at the Reconstruction - era prison in Kansas , this disciplinary instrument involved the inmate 's being placed in a coffin - like box about six - and - a-half feet long , thirty inches wide , and three - feet deep . The inmate would lie face down , his or her hands cuffed behind the back , while keepers slowly filled the crib with water to simulate drowning . Although wardens tended to believe these measures were necessary for control , contemporary observers generally found them `` unquestionably cruel and unusual , '' according to Rothman . Northern states continued to lease the labor of their convicts to private business interests in the post-war years . The Thirteenth Amendment , adopted in 1865 , expressly permitted slavery `` as a punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted . '' In Northern prisons , the state generally housed and fed inmate laborers , while contractors brought all necessary machinery to the prison facility and leased the inmates ' time . Abuses were common , according to investigative reporter Scott Christianson , as employers and guards tried to extract as much time and effort from prisoners as possible . At New Jersey 's prison at Trenton , after an inmate died while being `` stretched '' by the prison staff , a committee investigating discipline at the prison determined that officials had poured alcohol on epileptics and set them on fire to see if they were faking convulsions in order to skip work . At an Ohio penitentiary , unproductive convicts were made to sit naked in puddles of water and receive electric shocks from an induction coil . In New York , public investigations of practices in the state 's prisons became increasingly frequent during the 1840s , 1860s , and 1870s -- though with little actual effect on conditions . They revealed that a prisoner had been poisoned to death for not working in one institution ; another was found to have been kept chained to the floor for ten months in solitary confinement , until he eventually suffered a mental breakdown . By and large , Americans of the 1870s , 1880s , and 1890s did little to address the disciplinary and other abuses in United States penitentiaries of the time . One reason for this apathy , according to authors Scott Christianson and David Rothman , was the composition of contemporary prison populations . Following the Civil War , the volume of immigration to the United States increased alongside expanding nativist sentiment , which had been a fixture of national politics since long before the War . During the 1870s , as many as 3 million immigrants arrived on the shores of the United States . By the 1880s , the influx rose to 5.2 million , as immigrants fled persecution and unrest in eastern and southern Europe . This trend continued until immigration reached a zenith between 1904 and 1914 of 1 million persons per year . Already in the 1850s and 1860s , prisons ( along with asylums for the mentally ill ) were becoming the special preserve of the foreign - born and the poor . This trend accelerated as the nineteenth century drew to a close . In Illinois , for example , 60 percent of inmates in 1890 were foreign - born or second - generation immigrants -- Irish and German , mostly . Less than one - third of the Illinois inmates had completed grammar school , only 5 percent had a high school or college education , and the great majority held unskilled or semi-skilled jobs . In the 1890s California , 45 percent of prisoners were foreign - born -- predominantly of Chinese , Mexican , Irish , and German descent -- and the majority were laborers , waiters , cooks , or farmers . Throughout the post-war years , the rate of imprisonment for foreign - born Americans was twice that of native - born ones ; black Americans were incarcerated , North and South , at three times the rate of white Americans . The Civil War 's end also witnessed the emergence of pseudo-scientific theories concerning biological superiority and inherited social inferiority . Commentators grafted the Darwinian concept of `` survival of the fittest '' onto notions of social class . Charles Loring Brace , author of The Dangerous Classes of New York ( 1872 ) , warned his readers that attempts to cure poverty through charity would backfire by lessening the poor 's chance of survival . Richard L. Dugdale , civic - minded New York merchant , toured thirteen county jails during the 1870s as a voluntary inspector for the prestigious Prison Association of New York . Reflecting on his observations in later writings , Dugdale traced crime to hereditary criminality and promiscuity . These views on race and genetics , Christianson and Rothman conclude , affected the various official supervisory bodies established to monitor regulatory compliance in United States prisons . Although these monitoring boards ( established either by the state executive or legislature ) would ostensibly ferret out abuses in the prison system , in the end their apathy toward the incarcerated population rendered them largely ill - equipped for task of ensuring even humane care , Rothman argues . State and federal judges , for their part , refrained from monitoring prison conditions until the 1950s . Persistent beliefs in inherited criminality and social inferiority also stoked a growing eugenics movement during the Reconstruction Era , which sought to `` improve '' the human race through controlled breeding and eliminate `` poor '' or `` inferior '' tendencies . By the late 1890s , eugenics programs were enjoying a `` full - blown renaissance '' in American prisons and institutions for the mentally ill , with leading physicians , psychologists , and wardens as proponents . Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso published a highly influential tract in 1878 entitled L'uomo delinquente ( or , The Criminal Man ) , which theorized that a primitive criminal type existed who was identifiable by physical symptoms or `` stigmata . '' Phrenology also became a popular `` science '' among prison officials ; at the height of the study 's popularity , the influential Reconstruction Era matron of Sing Sing Prison , Elizabeth W. Farnham , was one of its adherents , and officials at Eastern State Penitentiary maintained phrenological data on all inmates during the post-war years . As the field of physical anthropology gained traction in the 1880s , prisons became laboratories for studying eugenics , psychology , human intelligence , medicine , drug treatment , genetics , and birth control . Support for these initiatives sprang from the influential prison reform organizations in the United States at the time -- e.g. , the Prison Reform Congress , the National Conference for Charities and Corrections , the National Prison Congress , the Prison Association of New York , and the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons . New methods of identifying criminal tendencies and classifying offenders by threat level emerged from prison - based research . In 1896 , for instance , New York began requiring all persons sentenced to a penal institution for thirty days or more to be measured and photographed for state records . Eugenics studies in the prison setting led to the development of the vasectomy as a replacement for total castration . Eugenics studies of the day aimed to prevent the extinction or genetic deterioration of mankind through restraints on reproduction , according to author Scott Christianson . In the mid-1890s , the Kansas `` Home for the Feeble - Minded '' began performing mass castrations on all of its residents . And Indiana became the first state to enact a compulsory sterilization act for certain mentally ill and criminal persons in 1907 . John D. Rockefeller Jr. , a eugenics devotee , became involved in social Darwinist experiments in New York . In the 1910s , Rockefeller created the Bureau for Social Hygiene , which conducted experiments on female prisoners , with the state 's consent and financial support , to determine the roots of their criminality and `` mental defectiveness . '' Failure of Jacksonian reform and renewed efforts ( edit ) A new group of prison reformers emerged in the Reconstruction Era that maintained some optimism about the institution and initiated efforts to make the prison a center for moral rehabilitation . Their efforts led to some change in contemporary prisons , but it would take another period of reform during the Progressive Era for any significant structural revisions to the prison systems of the United States . The primary failure of Reconstruction Era penitentiaries , according to historian David Rothman , was administrative . State governors typically appointed political patrons to prison posts , which were usually not full - time or salaried . In the 1870s , for example , the board of the Utica , New York , asylum was composed of two bankers , a grain merchant , two manufacturers , two lawyers , and two general businessman . Prison oversight boards like the Utica one , composed of local businessmen , tended to defer to prison officials in most matters and focus solely on financial oversight , Rothman writes , and therefore tended to perpetuate the status quo . Prison reform efforts of the Reconstruction Era came from a variety of sources . Fears about genetic contamination by the `` criminal class '' and its effect on the future of mankind led to numerous moral policing efforts aimed at curbing promiscuity , prostitution , and `` white slavery '' in this period . Meanwhile , campaigns to criminalize domestic violence , especially toward children , and related temperance movements led to renewed commitment to `` law and order '' in many communities from the 1870s onward . When legislators ignored demands for more protection for women and children , feminist activists lobbied for harsher punishments for male criminal offenders -- including the whipping post , castration , and longer prison terms . Another group of reformers continued to justify penitentiaries for negative reasons -- i.e. , for fear that a sustained and successful attack on the prison system and its failings might yield a return to the `` barbarism '' of colonial - era punishments . Nevertheless , a degree of optimism continued to dominate the thinking of reformers in the post-Civil War period , according to historian David Rothman . By October 1870 , notable Reconstruction Era prison reformers Enoch Wines , Franklin Sanborn , Theodore Dwight , and Zebulon Brockway -- among others -- convened with the National Congress of Penitentiary and Reformatory Discipline in Cincinnati , Ohio . The resolutions that emerged from the conference , called the Declaration of Principles , became the chief planks of the penitentiary reform agenda in the United States for the next several decades . The essence of the National Congress ' agenda in the Declaration was a renewed commitment to the `` moral regeneration '' of offenders ( especially young ones ) through a new model of penitentiary . The National Congress ' Declaration of Principles characterized crime as `` a sort of moral disease . '' The Declaration stated that the `` great object ( of ) ... the treatment of criminals ... should be ( their ) moral regeneration ... the reformation of criminals , not the infliction of vindictive suffering . '' The Declaration took inspiration from the `` Irish mark system '' pioneered by penologist Sir Walter Crofton . The object of Crofton 's system was to teach prisoners how to lead an upright life through use of `` good - time '' credits ( for early release ) and other behavioral incentives . The Declaration 's primary goals were : ( 1 ) to cultivate prisoners ' sense of self - respect ; and ( 2 ) to place the prisoner 's destiny in his or her own hands . But the Declaration more broadly : Called for sanitary improvements and an end to the political appointment of prison administrators ; Welcomed the increased participation of women in prison management ; Advocated for a more progressive system of classifying prisoners based on individualized and continuous assessments of their character through a mark system ; Stressed the importance of educating inmates ; and Argued that prisoners ' wills must be won over via persuasion , not destroyed . The National Congress and those who responded to its agenda also hoped to implement a more open - ended sentencing code . They advocated for the replacement of the peremptory ( or mandatory ) sentences of the day , set by a judge after trial , with sentences of indeterminate length . True `` proof of reformation , '' the Congress Declaration provided , should replace the `` mere lapse of time '' in winning an inmate 's release from confinement . These suggestions anticipated the near - comprehensive adoption of indeterminate sentencing during the Progressive Era . In spite of its many `` progressive '' suggestions for penal reform , the National Congress showed little sensitivity to the plight of freed blacks and immigrants in the penal system , in the view of author Scott Christianson . Christianson notes that the National Congress ' membership generally subscribed to the prevailing contemporary notion that blacks and foreigners were disproportionately represented in the prison system due to their inherent depravity and social inferiority . The rise and decline of the Elmira Reformatory in New York during the latter part of the nineteenth century represents the most ambitious attempt in the Reconstruction Era to fulfill the goals set by the National Congress in the Declaration of Principles . Built in 1876 , the Elmira institution was designed to hold first - time felons , between the ages of sixteen and thirty , who were serving an indeterminate term of imprisonment set by their sentencing judge . Elmira inmates had to earn their way out of the institution through good behavior , as assessed through an elaborate grading system . The only limits on inmates ' terms of imprisonment were whatever upper threshold the legislature set for their offense . Elmira 's administration underscores the fundamental tension of contemporary penal reform , according to authors Scott Christianson and David Rothman . On the one hand , its purpose was to rehabilitate offenders ; on the other , its reform principles were tempered by a belief in the heretability of criminal behavior . Elmira 's first warden , National Congress member Zebulon Brockway , wrote in 1884 that at least one - half of his charges were `` incorrigible '' due to their genetics . Brockway further characterized modern criminals as `` to a considerable extent the product of our civilization and ... of emigration to our shore from the degenerated populations of crowded European marts . '' Brockway reserved the harshest disciplinary measures -- e.g. , frequent whippings and solitary confinement -- for those he deemed `` incorrigible '' ( primarily the mentally and physically disabled ) . Elmira was regarded by many contemporaries as a well - run , model institution in its early years . Nevertheless , by 1893 the reformatory was seriously overcrowded and Brockway 's ideas about genetic degeneracy , low - intelligence , and criminality came under fire as a result of his brutality toward the mentally and physically disabled . An 1894 executive investigation of Elmira 's disciplinary practices concluded that discipline in the institution was harsh , although it eventually cleared Brockway of charges that he practiced `` cruel , brutal , excessive , degrading and unusual punishment of inmates . '' But continuing stigma led the Brockway to resign from his post at Elmira by 1900 . Historian David Rothman characterizes Brockway 's departure from Elmira as marking the institution 's failure as a reformed penitentiary , since its methods were hardly different from those of other Jacksonian Era institutions that had survived into the post-war years . But Rothman also concludes that the Elmira experience suggested to contemporary reformers only that management was to blame , not their proposed system of incarceration generally . The Progressive Era of the early twentieth century thus witnessed renewed efforts to implement the penal agenda espoused by the National Congress and its adherents in 1870 -- albeit with some noteworthy structural additions . Southern developments ( edit ) The Civil War brought overwhelming change to Southern society and its criminal justice system . As freed slaves joined the Southern population , they came under the primary control of local governments for the first time . At the same time , the market economy began to affect individuals and regions in the South that were previously untouched . Widespread poverty at the end of the nineteenth century unraveled the South 's prior race - based social fabric . In Reconstruction - era cities like Savannah , Georgia , intricate codes of racial etiquette began to unravel almost immediately after the war with the onset of emancipation . The local police forces that had been available in the antebellum South , depleted during the war , could not enforce the racial order as they had before . Nor was the white population , stricken by poverty and resentment , as united in its racial policing as it was during the antebellum period . By the end of Reconstruction , a new configuration of crime and punishment had emerged in the South : a hybrid , racialized form of incarceration at hard labor , with convicts leased to private businesses , that endured well into the twentieth century . Changing demographics of crime and punishment in the Reconstruction - Era South ( edit ) The economic turmoil of the post-war South reconstituted race relations and the nature of crime in the region , as whites attempted to reassert their supremacy . Earlier , extra-legal efforts toward reestablishing white supremacy , like those of the Ku Klux Klan , gradually gave way to more certain and less volatile forms of race control , according to historian Edward L. Ayers . Racial animosity and hatred grew as the races became ever more separate , Ayers argues , and Southern legal institutions turned much of their attention to preserving the racial status quo for whites . Patterns of `` mono - racial law enforcement , '' as Ayers refers to it , were established in Southern states almost immediately after the American Civil War . Cities that had never had police forces moved quickly to establish them , and whites became far less critical of urban police forces in post-war politics , whereas in the antebellum period they had engendered major political debate . Savannah , Georgia 's post-war police force was made up of Confederate veterans , who patrolled the city in gray uniforms , armed with rifles , revolvers , and sabers . They were led by an ex-Confederate General , Richard H. Anderson . Ayers concludes that white policemen protecting white citizens became the model for law enforcement efforts across the South after the American Civil War . Depressed economic conditions impacted both white and black farmers in the post-war South , as cotton prices entered a worldwide decline and interest rates on personal debt rose with `` astonishing '' speed after the close of hostilities . Property crime convictions in the Southern countryside , rare in the antebellum years , rose precipitously throughout the 1870s ( though violent crime by white offenders continued to take up the majority of the rural courts ' business ) . Former slaves who migrated to Southern cities , where they often received the lowest - paying jobs , were generally affected more acutely by economic downturns than their rural counterparts . Five years after the Civil War , 90 percent of the black population of Savannah , Georgia , owned no property . Increases in black property crime prosecutions in Savannah correlate to major economic downturns of the post-war period . Whites made few attempts to disguise the injustice in their courts , according to historian Edward L. Ayers . Blacks were uniformly excluded from juries and denied any opportunity to participate in the criminal justice process aside from being defendants . Thefts by black offenders became a new focus of the Southern justice systems and began to supplant violent crimes by white offenders in court dockets . Whether they were from the city or the countryside , those accused of property crime stood the greatest chance of conviction in post-war southern courts . But black defendants were convicted in the highest numbers . During the last half of the nineteenth century , three out of every five white defendants accused of property crime in Southern courts were convicted , while four out of every five black defendants were . Conviction rates for whites , meanwhile , dropped substantially from antebellum levels throughout the last half of the nineteenth century . This system of justice led , in the opinion of W.E.B. Du Bois , to a system in which neither blacks nor whites respected the criminal justice system -- whites because they were so rarely held accountable , and blacks because their own accountability felt so disproportionate . Ultimately , thousands of black Southerners served long terms on chain gangs for petty theft and misdemeanors in the 1860s and 1870s , while thousands more went into the convict lease system . In criminal sentencing , blacks were disproportionately sentenced to incarceration -- whether to the chain gang , convict leasing operation , or penitentiary -- in relation to their white peers . Black incarceration peaked before and after radical Reconstruction , when Southern whites exercised virtually unchecked power and restored `` efficiency '' to the criminal courts . For example , 384 of North Carolina 's 455 prisoners in 1874 were black , and in 1878 the proportion had increased slightly to 846 of 952 . By 1871 , 609 of Virginia 's 828 convicts in -- including all but four of its sixty - seven female prisoners -- were black . But this phenomenon was not specific to the South : The proportion of black inmates in Northern prisons was virtually identical to that in Southern prisons throughout the second half of the nineteenth century . Rural courts met so rarely in the post-war years that prisoners often sat in jails for months while awaiting trial , at the government 's expense . Chain gangs emerged in the post-war years as an initial solution to this economic deficit . Urban and rural counties moved the locus of criminal punishment from municipalities and towns to the county and began to change the economics of punishment from a heavy expense to a source of public `` revenue '' -- at least in terms of infrastructure improvements . Even misdemeanors could be turned to economic advantage ; defendants were often sentenced to only a few on the chain gang , with an additional three to eight months tacked onto the sentence to cover `` costs . '' As the Southern economy foundered in the wake of the peculiar institution 's destruction , and property crime rose , state governments increasingly explored the economic potential of convict labor throughout the Reconstruction period and into the twentieth century . Institutional power struggles over the Southern justice apparatus ( edit ) `` The most far - reaching change in the history of crime and punishment in the nineteenth - century South , '' according to historian Edward L. Ayers , was `` the state 's assumption of control over blacks from their ex-masters ... '' The process by which this occurred was `` halting and tenuous , '' but the transition began the moment a master told his slaves they were free . '' In this landscape , Ayers writes , the Freedmen 's Bureau vied with Southern whites -- through official government apparatuses and informal organizations like the Ku Klux Klan -- over opposing notions of justice in the post-war South . Southern whites in the main tried to salvage as much of the antebellum order as possible in the wake of the American Civil War , waiting to see what changes might be forced upon them . The `` Black Codes '' enacted almost immediately after the war -- Mississippi and South Carolina passed theirs as early as 1865 -- were an initial effort in this direction . Although they did not use racial terms , the Codes defined and punished a new crime , `` vagrancy , '' broadly enough to guarantee that most newly free black Americans would remain in a de facto condition of servitude . The Codes vested considerable discretion in local judges and juries to carry out this mission : County courts could choose lengths and types of punishment previously unavailable . The available punishments for vagrancy , arson , rape , and burglary in particular -- thought by whites to be peculiarly black crimes -- widened considerably in the post-war years . Soon after hostilities officially ceased between the United States and the Confederate States of America , black `` vagrants '' in Nashville , Tennessee , and New Orleans , Louisiana , were being fined and sent to the city workhouse . In San Antonio , Texas , and Montgomery , Alabama , free blacks were arrested , imprisoned , and put to work on the streets to pay for their own upkeep . A Northern journalist who passed through Selma , Alabama , immediately after of the war , was told that no white man had ever been sentenced to the chain gang , but that blacks were now being condemned to it for such `` crimes '' as `` using abusive language towards a white man '' or selling farm produce within the town limits . At the same time that Reconstruction Era Southern governments enacted the `` Black Codes '' , they also began to change the nature of the state 's penal machinery to make it into an economic development tool . Social historian Marie Gottschalk characterizes the use of penal labor by Southern state governments during the post-war years as an `` important bridge between an agricultural economy based on slavery and the industrialization and agricultural modernization of the New South . '' Many prisons in the South were in a state of disrepair by the end of the American Civil War , and state budgets across the region were exhausted . Mississippi 's penitentiary , for instance , was devastated during the war , and its funds depleted . In 1867 the state 's military government began leasing convicts to rebuild wrecked railroad and levees within the state . By 1872 , it began leasing convicts to Nathan Bedford Forrest , a former Confederate general and slave trader , as well as the first Imperial Wizard of the then emerging Ku Klux Klan . Texas also experienced a major postwar depression , in the midst of which its legislators enacted tough new laws calling for forced inmate labor within prison walls and at other works of public utility outside of the state 's detention facilities . Soon Texas began leasing convicts to railroads , irrigation and navigation projects , and lead , copper , and iron mines . Virginia 's prison at Richmond collapsed in the wake of the City 's 1865 surrender , but occupying Union forces rounded up as many convicts as they could in order to return them to work . Alabama began leasing out its Wetumpka Prison to private businessmen soon after the Civil War . During the Reconstruction Era , the North Carolina legislature authorized state judges to sentence offenders to work on chain gangs on county roads , railroads , or other internal improvements for a maximum term of one year -- though escapees who were recaptured would have to serve double their original sentence . North Carolina had failed to erect a penitentiary in the antebellum period , and its legislators planned to build an Auburn - style penitentiary to replace the penal labor system . But graft and shady dealings soon rendered a new prison impracticable , and North Carolina convicts continued to be leased to railroad companies . Freed blacks became the primary workers in the South 's emerging penal labor system . Those accused of property crime -- white or black -- stood the greatest chance of conviction in post-war Southern courts . But black property offenders were convicted more often than white ones -- at a rate of eight convictions for every ten black defendants , compared to six of every ten white defendants . Overall , conviction rates for whites dropped substantially from antebellum levels during the Reconstruction Era and continued to decline throughout the last half of the nineteenth century . The Freedmen 's Bureau , charged with implementing congressional reconstruction throughout the former Confederate states , was the primary political body that opposed the increasing racial overtones of Southern criminal justice during the Reconstruction Era . The Bureau 's mission reflected a strong faith in impersonal legalism , according to historian Edward L. Ayers , and its agents were to act as guarantors of blacks ' legal equality . The Bureau maintained courts in the South from 1865 to 1868 to adjudicate minor civil and criminal cases involving freed slaves . Ultimately , Ayers concludes , the Bureau largely failed to protect freed slaves from crime and violence by whites , or from the injustices of the Southern legal system , although the Bureau did provide much needed services to freed slaves in the form of food , clothing , school support , and assistance in contracts . The Greensboro , North Carolina Herald more bluntly stated that the Freedmen 's Bureau was no match for the `` Organic Law of the Land '' in the South , white supremacy . In the rural South , the Freedmen 's Bureau was only as strong as its isolated agents , who were often unable to assert their will over that of the whites in their jurisdiction . Manpower issues and local white resentment led to early compromises under which southern civilians were allowed to serve as magistrates on the Freedmen 's Courts , although the move was opposed by many former slaves . In cities like Savannah , Georgia , the Freedmen 's Courts appeared even more disposed to enforcing the wishes of local whites , sentencing former slaves ( and veterans of the Union Army ) to chain gangs , corporal punishments , and public shaming . The Savannah Freedmen 's Courts even approved arrests for such `` offenses '' as `` shouting at a religious colored meeting , '' or speaking disrespectfully to a white man . The Bureau 's influence on post-war patterns of crime and punishment was temporary and limited . The United States Congress believed that only its unprecedented federal intrusion into state affairs through the Bureau could bring true republicanism to the South , according to Edward L. Ayers , but Southerners instinctively resented this as a grave violation of their own republican ideals . Southerners had always tended to circumscribe the sphere of written , institutionalized law , Ayers argues , and once they began to associate it with outside oppression from the federal government , they saw little reason to respect it at all . From this resentment , vigilante groups like the Ku Klux Klan arose in opposition to the Bureau and its mission -- though , in the words of Ayers , the Klan was a `` relatively brief episode in a long history of post-war group violence in the South , '' where extralegal retribution was and continued to be a tradition . For their part , former slaves in the Reconstruction - era South made efforts of their own to counteract white supremacist violence and injustice . In March 1866 , Abraham Winfield and ten other black men petitioned the head of the Georgia Freedmen 's Bureau for relief from the oppression of the Bureau 's Court in Savannah -- especially for Civil War veterans . In rural areas like Greene County , Georgia , blacks met vigilante violence from whites with violence of their own . But with the withdrawal of the Freedmen 's Bureau in 1868 and continuing political violence from whites , blacks ultimately lost this struggle , according to historian Edward L. Ayers . Southern courts were largely unable -- even they were willing -- to bring whites to justice for violence against black Southerners . By the early to mid-1870s , white political supremacy had been established anew across most of the South . In Southern cities , a different form of violence emerged in the post-war years . Race riots erupted in Southern cities almost immediately after the war and continued for years afterward . Edward L. Ayers concludes that antebellum legal restraints on blacks and widespread poverty were the primary cause of many of these clashes . Whites resented labor competition from blacks in the depressed post-war Southern economy , and police forces -- many composed of unreconstructed Southerners -- often resorted to violence . The ultimate goal for both blacks and whites was to obtain political power in the vacuum created by war and emancipation ; again , blacks ultimately lost this struggle during the Reconstruction period . Beginning of the convict lease system ( edit ) Convict leasing , practiced in the North from the earliest days of the penitentiary movement , was taken up by Southern states in earnest following the American Civil War . The use of convict labor remained popular nationwide throughout the post-war period . An 1885 national survey reported that 138 institutions employed over 53,000 inmates in industries , who produced goods valued at $28.8 million . Although this was a relatively small sum in comparison to the estimated $5.4 billion in goods produced by free labor in 1880 , prison labor was big business for those involved in particular industries . But convict leasing in the post-war South came to play a more central role in crime and punishment than in the North , and it continued to do so with the approbation of the South 's leading men until well into the twentieth century . For over a half - century following the Civil War , convict camps dotted the Southern landscape , and thousands of men and women -- most of them former slaves -- passed years of their lives within the system . Men with capital , from the North and the South , bought years of these convicts ' lives and put them to work in large mining and railroad operations , as well as smaller everyday businesses . On average , the death rate in Southern leasing arrangements exceeded that in Northern prisons three-fold . The convict lease , as practiced in the South , was not just a bald attempt by state governments to resurrect slavery , according to historians Edward L. Ayers and Marie Gottschalk . It reflected continuities in race relations , both argue , but it also reflected fundamental changes in the post-war Southern economy . For first time , millions of freed slaves came under the centralized control of state penal apparatuses ; at the same time , nascent industrial capitalism in the South faced a shortage of both capital and labor . Former slaves were the easiest Southern demographic to impress into service and adapt southern industries to these changes . Ultimately , however , the longest legacy of the system may be as symbol for white South 's injustice and inhumanity . In 1912 , Dr. E. Stagg of the National Commission on Prison Labor described the status of the Southern convict as `` the last surviving vestige of the slave system . '' A Northern writer in the 1920s referred to the Southern chain gang as the South 's new `` peculiar institution '' . Southern penitentiaries from the antebellum period by and large continued to fall into disrepair in the post-war years as they became mere outposts of the much larger convict labor system . One by one , Southern penitentiary systems had disintegrated during the American Civil War . Mississippi sent its prisoners to Alabama for safekeeping in the midst of a Northern invasion . Louisiana concentrated its prisoners into a single urban workhouse . Arkansas dispersed its convicts in 1863 when the Union Army breached its borders . Occupied Tennessee hired its prisoners out to the United States government , while Georgia freed its inmates as General William Tecumseh Sherman headed for Atlanta with his armies in 1864 . With the fall of Richmond , most of Virginia 's prisoners escaped . The convict lease system emerged haltingly from this chaos , Edward L. Ayers and Marie Gottschalk conclude , just as the penitentiary itself had in years past . The penitentiary had become a Southern institution at this point , Ayers points out , and its complete abolition would have required a major renovation of state criminal codes . Some states , like Georgia , tried to revive their penitentiary systems in the post-war years , but had to first deal with crumbling state infrastructure and a growing prison population . The three states that had not established prisons in the antebellum period -- i.e. , the Carolinas and Florida -- hastened to establish them during Reconstruction . But many Southern states -- including North Carolina , Mississippi , Virginia , and Georgia -- soon turned to the lease system as a temporary expedient , as rising costs and convict populations outstripped their meager resources . According to Edward L. Ayers , `` ( t ) he South ... more or less stumbled into the lease , seeking a way to avoid large expenditures while hoping a truly satisfactory plan would emerge . '' Social historian Marie Gottschalk characterizes these leasing arrangements as an `` important bridge between an agricultural economy based on slavery and the industrialization and agricultural modernization of the New South . '' This may help to explain why support for the convict lease was altogether widespread in Southern society , Ayers concludes . No single group -- black or white , Republican or Democrat -- consistently opposed the lease once it gained power . The labor that convict lessees performed varied as the Southern economy evolved after the American Civil War . Ex-plantation owners were early beneficiaries , but emerging industrial capitalism ventures -- e.g. , phosphate mines and turpentine plants in Florida , railroads in Mississippi ( and across the South ) -- soon came to demand convict labor . The South experienced an acute labor shortage in the post-war years , Edward L. Ayers explains , and no pool of displaced agricultural laborers was available to feed the needs of factory owners , as they had been in England and on the Continent . The lease system was useful for capitalists who wanted to make money quickly : Labor costs were fixed and low , and labor uncertainty was reduced to the vanishing point . Convicts could be and were driven to a point free laborers would not tolerate ( and could not drink or misbehave ) . Although labor unrest and economic depression continued to rile the North and its factories , the lease system insulated its beneficiaries in South from these external costs . In many cases , Edward L. Ayers writes , the businessmen who utilized the convict - lease system were the same politicians who administered it . The system became , Ayers argues , a sort of `` mutual aid society '' for the new breed of capitalists and politicians who controlled the white Democratic regimes of the New South . Thus , Ayers concludes , officials often had something to hide , and contemporary reports on leasing operations often skirted or ignored the appalling conditions and death rates that attended these projects . In Alabama , 40 percent of convict lessees died during their term of labor in 1870 -- death rates for 1868 and 1869 were 18 and 17 percent , respectively . Lessees on Mississippi 's convict labor projects died at nine times the rate of inmates in Northern prisons throughout the 1880s . One man who had served time in the Mississippi system claimed that reported death rates would have been far higher had the state not pardoned many broken convicts before they died , so that they could do so at home instead . Compared to contemporary non-leasing prison systems nationwide , which recouped only 32 percent of expenses on average , convict leasing systems earned average profits of 267 percent . Even in comparison to Northern factories , Edward L. Ayers writes , the lease system 's profitability was real and sustained in the post-war years and remained so into the twentieth century . Exposes on the lease system began appearing with increasing frequency in newspapers , state documents , Northern publications , and the publications of national prison associations during the post-war period -- just as they did for Northern prisons like those in New York . Mass grave sites containing the remains of convict lessees have been discovered in Southern states like Alabama , where the United States Steel Corporation purchased convict labor for its mining operations for several years at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries . The focus of Southern justice on racial control in the post-war years had a profound effect on the demographics of the lease systems ' populations . Before the Civil War , virtually all Southern prisoners were white , but under post-war leasing arrangements almost all ( approximately 90 percent ) were black . In the antebellum period , white immigrants made up a disproportionate share of the South 's prison population before all but disappearing from prison records in the post-war period . The reasons for this are likely two-fold , Edward L. Ayers suggests . First , white immigrants generally avoided the post-war South due to its generally poor economic climate and the major increase in labor competition posed by emancipated slaves . Second , the preoccupation of post-war Southern police forces with crime committed by blacks decreased their efforts among the white population , including immigrants . The source of convicts also changed in the post-war South . Before the American Civil War , rural counties sent few defendants to the state penitentiaries , but after the war rural courts became steady suppliers to their states ' leasing systems ( though cities remained the largest supplier of convict lessees during this period ) . Savannah , Georgia , for example , sent convicts to leasing operations at approximately three times the number that its population would suggest , a pattern amplified by the reality that 76 percent of all blacks convicted in its courts received a prison sentence . Most convicts were in their twenties or younger . The number of women in Southern prison systems , increased in the post-war years to about 7 percent , a ratio not incommensurate with other contemporary prisons in the United States , but a major increase for the South , which had previously boasted of the moral rectitude of its ( white ) female population . Virtually all such women were black . The officials who ran the South 's leasing operations tried to maintain strict racial separation in the convict camps , refusing to recognize social equality between the races even among felons . As one Southerner reported to the National Prison Congress in 1886 : Mixing the races in prison `` is akin to the torture anciently practised of tieing ( sic ) a murderer to the dead body of his victim limb to limb , from head to foot , until the decaying corpse brought death to the living . '' Whites who did end up in Southern prisons , according to Edward L. Ayers , were considered the lowest of their race . At least some legislators referred to white prisoners with the same racial epithets reserved for blacks at the time . The Southern lease system was something less than a `` total system . '' The vast majority of convict - lease camps were dispersed , with little in the way of walls or other securities measures -- although some Southern chain gangs were carted around in open - air cages to their work sites and kept in them at night . Order in the camps was generally tenuous at best , Edward L. Ayers argues . Escapes were frequent and the brutal punishments that characterized the camps -- chains , bloodhounds , guns , and corporal punishments -- were dealt with a palpable sense of desperation . ( At least some observers , however , questioned whether the high number of reported escapees was not a ploy to cover up foul play . ) Reflecting changing criminal dockets in the Southern courts , about half of prisoners in the lease system served sentences for property crime . Rehabilitation played no real role in the system . Whatever onus for reform there was fell on the shoulders of chaplains , Edward L. Ayers relates . As Warden J.H. Bankhead of the Alabama penitentiary observed in the 1870s : `` ( O ) ur system is a better training school for criminals than any of the dens of iniquity that exist in our large cities ... You may as well expect to instill decent habits into a hog as to reform a criminal whose habits and surroundings are as filthy as a pig 's . '' Some proponents of the lease claimed that the system would teach blacks to work , but many contemporary observers came to recognize -- as historian C. Vann Woodward later would -- that the system dealt a great blow to whatever moral authority white society had retained in its paternalistic approach to the `` race problem . '' Time in the penitentiary came to carry little stigma in the black community , as preachers and other community leaders spread word of its cruelty . Whites presented far from a united front in defense of the lease system during the Reconstruction Era . Reformers and government insiders began condemning the worst abuses of the system from early on . Newspapers began taking up the call by the 1880s , although they had defended it during the more politically charged years that immediately followed the Civil War . But the system also had its defenders -- at times even the reformers themselves , who chafed at Northern criticism even where they agreed with its substance . The `` scientific '' racial attitudes of the late nineteenth century also helped some supporters of the lease to assuage their misgivings . One commentator wrote that blacks died in such numbers on the convict lease farms because of the weakness of their inferior , `` uneducated '' blood . Economic , rather than moral , concerns underlay the more successful attacks on leasing . Labor launched effective opposition movements to the lease in the post-war period . Birmingham , Alabama , and its Anti-Convict League , formed in 1885 , were the center of this movement , according to Ayers . Coal miner revolts against the lease occurred twenty - two recorded times in the South between 1881 and 1900 . By 1895 , Tennessee caved in to the demands of its miners and abolished its lease system . These revolts notably crossed racial lines . In Alabama , for instance , white and black free miners marched side - by - side to protest the use of convict labor in local mining operations . In these confrontations , convict labor surely took on a somewhat exaggerated importance to free workers , argues Edward L. Ayers . Only 27,000 convicts were engaged in some form of labor arrangement in the 1890s South . But the emerging nature of Southern industry and labor groups -- which tended to be smaller and more concentrated -- made for a situation in which a small number of convicts could affect entire industries . Progressive Era ( edit ) Southern developments ( edit ) Gradual demise of the convict lease ( edit ) Just as the convict lease emerged gradually in the post-war South , it also made a gradual exit . Although Virginia , Texas , Tennessee , Kentucky , and Missouri utilized Northern - style manufacturing prisons in addition to their farms , as late as 1890 the majority of Southern convicts still passed their sentences in convict camps run by absentee businessmen . But the 1890s also marked the beginning of a gradual shift toward compromise over the lease system , in the form of state - run prison farms . States began to cull the women , children , and the sick from the old privately run camps during this period , to remove them from the `` contamination '' of bad criminals and provide a healthier setting and labor regime . Mississippi enacted a new state constitution in 1890 that called for the end of the lease by 1894 . Despite these changes , and continuing attacks from labor movements , Populists , and Greenbackers , only two Southern states besides Mississippi ended the system prior to the twentieth century . Most Southern states did bring their systems under tighter control and make increasing use of state penal farms by the twentieth century , however , resulting in improved conditions and a decline in death rates . Georgia abolished its system in 1908 , after an expose by Charles Edward Russell in Everybody 's Magazine revealed `` hideous '' conditions on lease projects . A former warden described how men in the Georgia camps were hung by their thumbs as punishment , to the point that their thumbs became so stretched and deformed , to the length of index fingers , that they resembled the `` paws of certain apes . '' Florida 's prison camps -- where even the sick were forced to work under threat of a beating or shooting -- remained in use until 1923 . Replacements for the lease system , such as chain gangs and state prison farms , were not so different from their predecessors . An example of the lingering influence of the lease system can be found in the Arkansas prison farms . By the mid-twentieth century , Arkansas ' male penal system still consisted of two large prison farms , which remained almost totally cut off from the outside world and continued to operate much as they had during the Reconstruction Era . Conditions in these camps were bad enough that , as late as the 1960s , an Oregon judge refused to return escapees from Arkansas , who had been apprehended in his jurisdiction . The judge declared that returning the prisoners to Arkansas would make his state complicit in what he described as `` institutes of terror , horror , and despicable evil , '' which he compared to Nazi concentration camps . In 1966 , around the time of the Oregon judge 's ruling , the ratio of staff to inmates at the Arkansas penal farms was one staff member for every sixty - five inmates . By contrast , the national average at the time was around one prison staff member for every seven inmates . The state was not the only entity profiting from the farm ; private operators controlled certain of its industries and maintained high profit margins . The physician who ran the farm 's for - profit blood bank , for instance , earned between $130,000 and $150,000 per year off of inmate donations that he sold to hospitals . Faced with this acute shortage of manpower , authorities at the penal farms relied upon armed inmates , known as `` trusties '' or `` riders , '' to guard the convicts while they worked Under the trusties ' control prisoners worked ten to fourteen hours per day ( depending on the time of year ) , six days per week . Arkansas was , at the time , the only state where prison officials could still whip convicts . Violent deaths were commonplace on the Arkansaw prison farms . An investigation begun by incumbent Governor Orval Faubus during a heated 1966 gubernatorial race revealed ongoing abuses -- e.g. , use of wire pliers on inmates ' genitals , stabbings , use of nut crackers to break inmates knuckles , trampling of inmates with horses , and charging inmates for hospital time after beatings . When the chairman of the Arkansas legislature 's prison committee was asked about the allegations , however , he replied , `` Arkansas has the best prison system in the United States . '' Only later , after a federal court intervened , did reforms begin at the Arkansas prison camps .

Yemen is the second - largest country in the peninsula , occupying 527,970 km ( 203,850 sq mi ) . The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km ( 1,200 mi ) . It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north , the Red Sea to the west , the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south , and Oman to the east - northeast . Although Yemen 's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a , the city has been under Houthi rebel control since February 2015 . Because of this , Yemen 's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden , on the southern coast . Yemen 's territory includes more than 200 islands ; the largest of these is Socotra . Yemen was the home of the Sabaeans ( biblical Sheba ) , a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and also included parts of modern - day Ethiopia and Eritrea . In 275 AD , the region came under the rule of the later Jewish - influenced Himyarite Kingdom . Christianity arrived in the fourth century . Islam spread quickly in the seventh century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests . Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult . Several dynasties emerged from the ninth to 16th centuries , the Rasulid dynasty being the strongest and most prosperous . The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early twentieth century . The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1962 . South Yemen remained a British protectorate known as the Aden Protectorate until 1967 when it became an independent state and later , a Marxist state . The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of Yemen in 1990 . Yemen is a developing country , and the poorest country in the Middle East . Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , Yemen was described by critics as a kleptocracy . According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International , Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed . In the absence of strong state institutions , elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance , where competing tribal , regional , religious , and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced . The informal political settlement was held together by a power - sharing deal between three men : President Saleh , who controlled the state ; major general Ali Mohsen al - Ahmar , who controlled the largest share of the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces ; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al - Ahmar , figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia 's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players , including tribal sheikhs . The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes ' autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which to weigh in on Yemen 's political decision - making . It is a member of the United Nations , Arab League , Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation , G - 77 , Non-Aligned Movement , Arab Satellite Communications Organization , Arab Monetary Fund and the World Federation of Trade Unions . From 2011 , Yemen has been in a state of political crisis starting with street protests against poverty , unemployment , corruption , and president Saleh 's plan to amend Yemen 's constitution and eliminate the presidential term limit , in effect making him president for life . President Saleh stepped down and the powers of the presidency were transferred to Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi , who was formally elected president on 21 February 2012 in a one - man election . The transitional process was part of the UN-backed Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative known as National Dialogue Conference . In September 2014 , the Houthis took over Sana'a with the help of the ousted president Saleh , later declaring themselves in control of the country after a coup d'\u00e9tat . This resulted in a new civil war and a Saudi Arabian - led military intervention aimed at restoring Hadi 's government . The war has blocked food imports , leading to a famine that is affecting 17 million people . The lack of safe drinking water , caused by depleted aquifers and the destruction of the country 's water infrastructure , has also caused the world 's worst outbreak of cholera , with the number of suspected cases exceeding 913,741 . Over 2,196 people have died since the outbreak began to spread rapidly at the end of April 2017 .

In Arabic literature , the term al - Yaman includes much greater territory than that of the republic of Yemen . It stretches from the northern ' Asir Region in southwestern Saudi Arabia to Dhofar Governorate in southern Oman . One etymology derives Yemen from `` ymnt '' , meaning `` South '' , and significantly plays on the notion of the land to the right ( \ud802\ude7a\ud802\ude63\ud802\ude6c ) . Other sources claim that Yemen is related to `` yamn '' or `` yumn '' , meaning `` felicity '' or `` blessed '' as much of the country is fertile . The Romans called it Arabia Felix ( happy Arabia ) , as opposed to Arabia Deserta ( deserted Arabia ) . History ( edit ) Main article : History of Yemen Ancient History ( edit ) Main articles : Ancient history of Yemen , Sabaeans , Qataban , Minaeans , and Himyarite Kingdom With its long sea border between eastern and western civilizations , Yemen has long existed at a crossroads of cultures with a strategic location in terms of trade on the west of the Arabian Peninsula . Large settlements for their era existed in the mountains of northern Yemen as early as 5000 BC . A Sabaean gravestone of a woman holding a stylized sheaf of wheat , a symbol of fertility in ancient Yemen The Sabaean Kingdom came into existence from at least the 11th century BC . The four major kingdoms or tribal confederations in South Arabia were : Saba , Hadramout , Qataban , and Ma'in . Saba is thought to be biblical Sheba and was the most prominent federation . The Sabaean rulers adopted the title Mukarrib generally thought to mean unifier , or a priest - king , or the head of confederation of South Arabian kingdoms , the ' king of the kings ' . The role of the Mukarrib was to bring the various tribes under the kingdom and preside over them all . The Sabaens built the Great Dam of Marib around 940 BC . The dam was built to withstand the seasonal flash floods surging down the valley . Between 700 and 680 BC , the Kingdom of Awsan dominated Aden and its surroundings and challenged the Sabaean supremacy in the Arabian South . Sabaean Mukarrib Karib'il Watar I conquered the entire realm of Awsan , and expanded Sabaean rule and territory to include much of South Arabia . Lack of water in the Arabian Peninsula prevented the Sabaeans from unifying the entire peninsula . Instead , they established various colonies to control trade routes . Evidence of Sabaean influence is found in northern Ethiopia , where the South Arabian alphabet , religion and pantheon , and the South Arabian style of art and architecture were introduced . The Sabaean created a sense of identity through their religion . They worshipped El - Maqah and believed that they were his children . For centuries , the Sabaeans controlled outbound trade across the Bab - el - Mandeb , a strait separating the Arabian Peninsula from the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea from the Indian Ocean . By the third century BC , Qataban , Hadramout , and Ma'in became independent from Saba and established themselves in the Yemeni arena . Minaean rule stretched as far as Dedan , with their capital at Baraqish . The Sabaeans regained their control over Ma'in after the collapse of Qataban in 50 BCE . By the time of the Roman expedition to Arabia Felix in 25 BC , the Sabaeans were once again the dominating power in Southern Arabia . Aelius Gallus was ordered to lead a military campaign to establish Roman dominance over the Sabaeans . The Romans had a vague and contradictory geographical knowledge about Arabia Felix or Yemen . The Roman army of 10,000 men was defeated before Marib . Strabo 's close relationship with Aelius Gallus led him to attempt to justify his friend 's defeat in his writings . It took the Romans six months to reach Marib and 60 days to return to Egypt . The Romans blamed their Nabataean guide and executed him for treachery . No direct mention in Sabaean inscriptions of the Roman expedition has yet been found . A funerary stela featuring a musical scene , first century AD Himyarite King Dhamar Ali Yahbur II After the Roman expedition -- perhaps earlier -- the country fell into chaos , and two clans , namely Hamdan and Himyar , claimed kingship , assuming the title King of Sheba and Dhu Raydan . Dhu Raydan , i.e. , Himyarites , allied themselves with Aksum in Ethiopia against the Sabaeans . The chief of Bakil and king of Saba and Dhu Raydan , El Sharih Yahdhib , launched successful campaigns against the Himyarites and Habashat , i.e. , Aksum , El Sharih took pride in his campaigns and added the title Yahdhib to his name , which means `` suppressor '' ; he used to kill his enemies by cutting them to pieces . Sana'a came into prominence during his reign , as he built the Ghumdan Palace as his place of residence . The Himyarite annexed Sana'a from Hamdan around 100 AD . Hashdi tribesmen rebelled against them and regained Sana'a around 180 AD . Shammar Yahri'sh had not conquered Hadramout , Najran , and Tihama until 275 AD , thus unifying Yemen and consolidating Himyarite rule . The Himyarites rejected polytheism and adhered to a consensual form of monotheism called Rahmanism . In 354 AD , Roman Emperor Constantius II sent an embassy headed by Theophilos the Indian to convert the Himyarites to Christianity . According to Philostorgius , the mission was resisted by local Jews . Several inscriptions have been found in Hebrew and Sabaean praising the ruling house in Jewish terms for `` ... helping and empowering the People of Israel . '' According to Islamic traditions , King As'ad the Perfect mounted a military expedition to support the Jews of Yathrib . Abu Kariba As'ad , as known from the inscriptions , led a military campaign to central Arabia or Najd to support the vassal Kingdom of Kindah against the Lakhmids . However , no direct reference to Judaism or Yathrib was discovered from his lengthy reign . Abu Kariba died in 445 AD , having reigned for almost 50 years . By 515 AD , Himyar became increasingly divided along religious lines and a bitter conflict between different factions paved the way for an Aksumite intervention . The last Himyarite king Ma'adikarib Ya'fur was supported by Aksum against his Jewish rivals . Ma'adikarib was Christian and launched a campaign against the Lakhmids in southern Iraq , with the support of other Arab allies of Byzantium . The Lakhmids were a Bulwark of Persia , which was intolerant to a proselytizing religion like Christianity . After the death of Ma'adikarib Ya'fur around 521 AD , a Himyarite Jewish warlord named Yousef Asar Yathar rose to power with the honorary title of Yathar ( meaning , `` to avenge '' ) . Yemenite Christians , aided by Aksum and Byzantium , systematically persecuted Jews and burned down several synagogues across the land . Yousef avenged his people with great cruelty . He marched toward the port city of Mocha , killing 14,000 and capturing 11,000 . Then he settled a camp in Bab - el - Mandeb to prevent aid flowing from Aksum . At the same time , Yousef sent an army under the command of another Jewish warlord , Sharahil Yaqbul , to Najran . Sharahil had reinforcements from the Bedouins of the Kindah and Madh'hij tribes , eventually wiping out the Christian community in Najran . Yousef or Dhu Nuwas ( the one with sidelocks ) as known in Arabic literature , believed that Christians in Yemen were a fifth column . Christian sources portray Dhu Nuwas ( Yousef Asar ) as a Jewish zealot , while Islamic traditions say that he threw 20,000 Christians into pits filled with flaming oil . This history , however , is shrouded in legend . Dhu Nuwas left two inscriptions , neither of them making any reference to fiery pits . Byzantium had to act or lose all credibility as protector of eastern Christianity . It is reported that Byzantium Emperor Justin I sent a letter to the Aksumite King Kaleb , pressuring him to `` ... attack the abominable Hebrew . '' A tripartite military alliance of Byzantine , Aksumite , and Arab Christians successfully defeated Yousef around 525 -- 527 AD , and a client Christian king was installed on the Himyarite throne . The ruins of The Great Dam of Marib Esimiphaios was a local Christian lord , mentioned in an inscription celebrating the burning of an ancient Sabaean palace in Marib to build a church on its ruins . Three new churches were built in Najran alone . Many tribes did not recognize Esimiphaios 's authority . Esimiphaios was displaced in 531 by a warrior named Abraha , who refused to leave Yemen and declared himself an independent king of Himyar . Emperor Justinian I sent an embassy to Yemen . He wanted the officially Christian Himyarites to use their influence on the tribes in inner Arabia to launch military operations against Persia . Justinian I bestowed the `` dignity of king '' upon the Arab sheikhs of Kindah and Ghassan in central and northern Arabia . From early on , Roman and Byzantine policy was to develop close links with the powers of the coast of the Red Sea . They were successful in converting Aksum and influencing their culture . The results with regard to Yemen were rather disappointing . A Kendite prince called Yazid bin Kabshat rebelled against Abraha and his Arab Christian allies . A truce was reached once the Great Dam of Marib had suffered a breach . Abraha died around 555 -- 565 ; no reliable sources regarding his death are available . The Sasanid empire annexed Aden around 570 AD . Under their rule , most of Yemen enjoyed great autonomy except for Aden and Sana'a . This era marked the collapse of ancient South Arabian civilization , since the greater part of the country was under several independent clans until the arrival of Islam in 630 AD . Middle ages ( edit ) See also : Islamic history of Yemen Advent of Islam and the three Dynasties ( edit ) Main articles : Yufirids , Ziyadid Dynasty , and Imams of Yemen The interior of the Great Mosque of Sana'a , the oldest mosque in Yemen Muhammed sent his cousin Ali to Sana'a and its surroundings around 630 AD . At the time , Yemen was the most advanced region in Arabia . The Banu Hamdan confederation was among the first to accept Islam . Muhammed sent Muadh ibn Jabal , as well to Al - Janad , in present - day Taiz , and dispatched letters to various tribal leaders . The reason behind this was the division among the tribes and the absence of a strong central authority in Yemen during the days of the prophet . Major tribes , including Himyar , sent delegations to Medina during the `` year of delegations '' around 630 -- 631 AD . Several Yemenis accepted Islam before the year 630 , such as Ammar ibn Yasir , Al - Ala'a Al - Hadrami , Miqdad ibn Aswad , Abu Musa Ashaari , and Sharhabeel ibn Hasana . A man named ' Abhala ibn Ka'ab Al - Ansi expelled the remaining Persians and claimed he was a prophet of Rahman . He was assassinated by a Yemeni of Persian origin called Fayruz al - Daylami . Christians , who were mainly staying in Najran along with Jews , agreed to pay Jizya , although some Jews converted to Islam , such as Wahb ibn Munabbih and Ka'ab al - Ahbar . Yemen was stable during the Rashidun Caliphate . Yemeni tribes played a pivotal role in the Islamic expansion of Egypt , Iraq , Persia , the Levant , Anatolia , North Africa , Sicily , and Andalusia . Yemeni tribes who settled in Syria , contributed significantly to the solidification of Umayyad rule , especially during the reign of Marwan I. Powerful Yemenite tribes such as Kindah were on his side during the Battle of Marj Rahit . Several emirates led by people of Yemeni descent were established in North Africa and Andalusia . Effective control over entire Yemen was not achieved by the Umayyad Caliphate . Imam Abdullah ibn Yahya Al - Kindi was elected in 745 AD to lead the Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b movement in Hadramawt and Oman . He expelled the Umayyad governor from Sana'a and captured Mecca and Medina in 746 AD . Al - Kindi , known by his nickname `` Talib al - Haqq '' ( seeker of truth ) , established the first Ibadi state in the history of Islam , but was killed in Taif around 749 AD . Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Ziyad founded the Ziyadid dynasty in Tihama around 818 AD . The state stretched from Haly ( in present - day Saudi Arabia ) to Aden . They nominally recognized the Abbasid Caliphate , but were in fact ruling independently from their capital in Zabid . The history of this dynasty is obscure . They never exercised control over the highlands and Hadramawt , and did not control more than a coastal strip of the Yemen ( Tihama ) bordering the Red Sea . A Himyarite clan called the Yufirids established their rule over the highlands from Saada to Taiz , while Hadramawt was an Ibadi stronghold and rejected all allegiance to the Abbasids in Baghdad . By virtue of its location , the Ziyadid dynasty of Zabid developed a special relationship with Abyssinia . The chief of the Dahlak islands exported slaves , as well as amber and leopard hides , to the then ruler of Yemen . The first Zaidi imam , Yahya ibn al - Husayn , arrived in Yemen in 893 AD . He was the founder of the Zaidi imamate in 897 . He was a religious cleric and judge who was invited to come to Saada from Medina to arbitrate tribal disputes . Imam Yahya persuaded local tribesmen to follow his teachings . The sect slowly spread across the highlands , as the tribes of Hashid and Bakil , later known as `` the twin wings of the imamate , '' accepted his authority . Yahya established his influence in Saada and Najran . He also tried to capture Sana'a from the Yufirids in 901 AD , but failed miserably . In 904 , the Qarmatians invaded Sana'a . The Yufirid emir As'ad ibn Ibrahim retreated to Al - Jawf , and between 904 and 913 , Sana'a was conquered no less than 20 times by Qarmatians and Yufirids . As'ad ibn Ibrahim regained Sana'a in 915 . Yemen was in turmoil as Sana'a became a battlefield for the three dynasties , as well as independent tribes . The Yufirid emir Abdullah ibn Qahtan attacked and burned Zabid in 989 , severely weakening the Ziyadid dynasty . The Ziyadid monarchs lost effective power after 989 , or even earlier than that . Meanwhile , a succession of slaves held power in Zabid and continued to govern in the name of their masters , eventually establishing their own dynasty around 1022 or 1050 according to different sources . Although they were recognized by the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad , they ruled no more than Zabid and four districts to its north . The rise of the Ismaili Shia Sulayhid dynasty in the Yemeni highlands reduced their history to a series of intrigues . Sulayhid dynasty ( 1047 -- 1138 ) ( edit ) Main article : Sulayhid dynasty Jibla became the capital of the Sulayhid dynasty . The Sulayhid dynasty was founded in the northern highlands around 1040 ; at the time , Yemen was ruled by different local dynasties . In 1060 , Ali ibn Muhammed Al - Sulayhi conquered Zabid and killed its ruler Al - Najah , founder of the Najahid dynasty . His sons were forced to flee to Dahlak . Hadramawt fell into Sulayhid hands after their capture of Aden in 1162 . By 1063 , Ali had subjugated Greater Yemen . He then marched toward Hejaz and occupied Makkah . Ali was married to Asma bint Shihab , who governed Yemen with her husband . The Khutba during Friday prayers was proclaimed in her husband and her names . No other Arab woman had this honor since the advent of Islam . Ali al - Sulayhi was killed by Najah 's sons on his way to Mecca in 1084 . His son Ahmed Al - Mukarram led an army to Zabid and killed 8,000 of its inhabitants . He later installed the Zurayids to govern Aden . al - Mukarram , who had been afflicted with facial paralysis resulting from war injuries , retired in 1087 and handed over power to his wife Arwa al - Sulayhi . Queen Arwa moved the seat of the Sulayhid dynasty from Sana'a to Jibla , a small town in central Yemen near Ibb . Jibla was strategically near the Sulayhid dynasty source of wealth , the agricultural central highlands . It was also within easy reach of the southern portion of the country , especially Aden . She sent Ismaili missionaries to India , where a significant Ismail community was formed that exists to this day . Queen Arwa continued to rule securely until her death in 1138 . Queen Arwa al - Sulaihi Palace Arwa al - Sulayhi is still remembered as a great and much loved sovereign , as attested in Yemeni historiography , literature , and popular lore , where she is referred to as Balqis al - sughra ( `` the junior queen of Sheba '' ) . Although the Sulayhids were Ismaili , they never tried to impose their beliefs on the public . Shortly after Queen Arwa 's death , the country was split between five competing petty dynasties along religious lines . The Ayyubid dynasty overthrew the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt . A few years after their rise to power , Saladin dispatched his brother Turan Shah to conquer Yemen in 1174 . Ayyubid Conquest ( 1171 -- 1260 ) ( edit ) Main article : Ayyubid Dynasty Turan Shah conquered Zabid from the Mahdids in May 1174 , then marched toward Aden in June and captured it from the Zurayids . The Hamdanid sultans of Sana'a resisted the Ayyubid in 1175 , and the Ayyubids did not manage to definitely secure Sana'a until 1189 . The Ayyubid rule was stable in southern and central Yemen , where they succeeded in eliminating the ministates of that region , while Ismaili and Zaidi tribesmen continued to hold out in a number of fortresses . The Ayyubids failed to capture the Zaydis stronghold in northern Yemen . In 1191 , Zaydis of Shibam Kawkaban rebelled and killed 700 Ayyubid soldiers . Imam Abdullah bin Hamza proclaimed the imamate in 1197 and fought al - Mu'izz Ismail , the Ayyubid Sultan of Yemen . Imam Abdullah was defeated at first , but was able to conquer Sana'a and Dhamar in 1198 al - Mu'izz Ismail was assassinated in 1202 . Abdullah bin Hamza carried on the struggle against the Ayyubid until his death in 1217 . After his demise , the Zaidi community was split between two rival imams . The Zaydis were dispersed and a truce was signed with the Ayyubid in 1219 . The Ayyubid army was defeated in Dhamar in 1226 . Ayyubid Sultan Mas'ud Yusuf left for Mecca in 1228 , never to return . Other sources suggest that he was forced to leave for Egypt instead in 1123 . Rasulid dynasty ( 1229 -- 1454 ) ( edit ) Main article : Rasulid dynasty Al - Qahyra ( Cairo ) Castle 's Garden in Taiz , the capital of Yemen during the Rasulid 's era The Rasulid Dynasty was established in 1229 by Umar ibn Rasul , who was appointed deputy governor by the Ayyubids in 1223 . When the last Ayyubid ruler left Yemen in 1229 , Umar stayed in the country as caretaker . He subsequently declared himself an independent king by assuming the title `` al - Malik Al - Mansur '' ( the king assisted by Allah ) . Umar established the Rasulid dynasty on a firm foundation and expanded its territory to include the area from Dhofar to Mecca Umar first established himself at Zabid , then moved into the mountainous interior , taking the important highland centre Sana'a . However , the Rasulid capitals were Zabid and Taiz . He was assassinated by his nephew in 1249 . Omar 's son Yousef defeated the faction led by his father 's assassins and crushed several counter-attacks by the Zaydi imams who still held on in the northern highland . Mainly because of the victories he scored over his rivals , he assumed the honorific title `` al - Muzaffar '' ( the victorious ) . After the fall of Baghdad to the Mongols in 1258 , al - Muzaffar Yusuf I appropriated the title of caliph . He chose the city of Taiz to become the political capital of the kingdom because of its strategic location and proximity to Aden . al - Muzaffar Yusuf I died in 1296 , having reigned for 47 years . When the news of his death reached the Zaydi imam Al - Mutawakkil al - Mutahhar bin Yahya , he commented , The greatest king of Yemen , the Muawiyah of the time , has died . His pens used to break our lances and swords to pieces . A 13th - century slave market in Yemen The Rasulid state nurtured Yemen 's commercial links with India and the Far East . They profited greatly by the Red Sea transit trade via Aden and Zabid . The economy also boomed due to the agricultural development programs instituted by the kings who promoted massive cultivation of palms . The Rasulid kings enjoyed the support of the population of Tihama and southern Yemen , while they had to buy the loyalty of Yemen 's restive northern highland tribes . The Rasulid sultans built numerous Madrasas to solidify the Shafi'i school of thought , which is still the dominant school of jurisprudence amongst Yemenis today . Under their rule , Taiz and Zabid became major international centers of Islamic learning . The kings themselves were learned men in their own right , who not only had important libraries , but who also wrote treatises on a wide array of subjects , ranging from astrology and medicine to agriculture and genealogy . The dynasty is regarded as the greatest native Yemeni state since the fall of pre-Islamic Himyarite Kingdom . They were of Turkic descent . They claimed an ancient Yemenite origin to justify their rule . The Rasulids were not the first dynasty to create a fictitious genealogy for political purposes , nor were they doing anything out of the ordinary in the tribal context of Arabia . By claiming descent from a solid Yemenite tribe , the Rasulids brought Yemen to a vital sense of unity in an otherwise chaotic regional milieu . They had a difficult relationship with the Mamluks of Egypt because the latter considered them a vassal state . Their competition centered over the Hejaz and the right to provide kiswa of the Ka'aba in Mecca . The dynasty became increasingly threatened by disgruntled family members over the problem of succession , combined by periodic tribal revolts , as they were locked in a war of attrition with the Zaydi imams in the northern highlands . During the last 12 years of Rasulid rule , the country was torn between several contenders for the kingdom . The weakening of the Rasulid provided an opportunity for the Banu Taher clan to take over and establish themselves as the new rulers of Yemen in 1454 AD . Tahiride dynasty ( 1454 -- 1517 ) ( edit ) Main article : Tahirids ( Yemen ) The Tahirids were a local clan based in Rada'a . While they were not as impressive as their predecessors , they were still keen builders . They built schools , mosques , and irrigation channels , as well as water cisterns and bridges in Zabid , Aden , Rada'a , and Juban . Their best - known monument is the Amiriya Madrasa in Rada ' District , which was built in 1504 . The Tahiride were too weak either to contain the Zaydi imams or to defend themselves against foreign attacks . The Mamluks of Egypt tried to attach Yemen to Egypt and the Portuguese led by Afonso de Albuquerque , occupied Socotra and made an unsuccessful attack on Aden in 1513 . The Portuguese posed an immediate threat to the Indian Ocean trade . The Mamluks of Egypt , therefore , sent an army under the command of Hussein Al - Kurdi to fight the intruders . The Mamluk sultan of Egypt sailed to Zabid in 1515 and began diplomatic talks with Tahiride Sultan ' Amir bin Abdulwahab for money that would be needed for jihad against the Portuguese . Instead of confronting the Portuguese , the Mamluks , who were running out of food and water , landed their fleet on the Yemen coastline and started to harass Tihama villagers for what they needed . Realizing how rich the Tahiride realm was , they decided to conquer it . The Mamluk army , with the support of forces loyal to Zaydi Imam Al - Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad - Din , conquered the entire realm of the Tahiride , but failed to capture Aden in 1517 . The Mamluk victory was short - lived . The Ottoman Empire conquered Egypt , hanging the last Mamluk Sultan in Cairo . The Ottomans had not decided to conquer Yemen until 1538 . The Zaydi highland tribes emerged as national heroes by offering a stiff , vigorous resistance to the Turkish occupation . Modern History ( edit ) See also : Modern history of Yemen The Zaydis and Ottomans ( edit ) See also : Yemen Eyalet Al Bakiriyya Ottoman Mosque in Sana'a , was built in 1597 The Ottomans had two fundamental interests to safeguard in Yemen : The Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina , and the trade route with India in spices and textiles -- both threatened , and the latter virtually eclipsed , by the arrival of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea in the early 16th century . Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha , The Ottoman governor of Egypt , was ordered to command a fleet of 90 ships to conquer Yemen . The country was in a state of incessant anarchy and discord as Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha described it by saying : Yemen is a land with no lord , an empty province . It would be not only possible but easy to capture , and should it be captured , it would be master of the lands of India and send every year a great amount of gold and jewels to Constantinople . Imam al - Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad - Din ruled over the northern highlands including Sana'a , while Aden was held by the last Tahiride Sultan ' Amir ibn Dauod . Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha stormed Aden in 1538 , killing its ruler , and extended Ottoman authority to include Zabid in 1539 and eventually Tihama in its entirety . Zabid became the administrative headquarters of Yemen Eyalet . The Ottoman governors did not exercise much control over the highlands . They held sway mainly in the southern coastal region , particularly around Zabid , Mocha , and Aden . Of 80,000 soldiers sent to Yemen from Egypt between 1539 and 1547 , only 7,000 survived . The Ottoman accountant - general in Egypt remarked : We have seen no foundry like Yemen for our soldiers . Each time we have sent an expeditionary force there , it has melted away like salt dissolved in water . The Ottomans sent yet another expeditionary force to Zabid in 1547 , while Imam al - Mutawakkil Yahya Sharaf ad - Din was ruling the highlands independently . Imam al - Mutawakkil Yahya chose his son Ali to succeed him , a decision that infuriated his other son al - Mutahhar ibn Yahya . Al - Mutahhar was lame , so was not qualified for the imamate . He urged Oais Pasha , the Ottoman colonial governor in Zabid , to attack his father . Indeed , Ottoman troops supported by tribal forces loyal to Imam al - Mutahhar stormed Taiz and marched north toward Sana'a in August 1547 . The Turks officially made Imam al - Mutahhar a Sanjak - bey with authority over ' Amran . Imam al - Mutahhar assassinated the Ottoman colonial governor and recaptured Sana'a , but the Ottomans , led by \u00d6zdemir Pasha , forced al - Mutahhar to retreat to his fortress in Thula . \u00d6zdemir Pasha effectively put Yemen under Ottoman rule between 1552 and 1560 . He was considered a competent ruler given Yemen 's notorious lawlessness , garrisoning the main cities , building new fortresses , and rendering secure the main routes . \u00d6zdemir died in Sana'a in 1561 , and was succeeded by Mahmud Pasha . Unlike \u00d6zdemir 's brief but able leadership , Mahmud Pasha was described by other Ottoman officials as a corrupt and unscrupulous governor . He used his authority to take over a number of castles , some of which belonged to the former Rasulid kings . Mahmud Pasha killed a Sunni scholar from Ibb . The Ottoman historian claimed that this incident was celebrated by the Zaydi Shia community in the northern highlands . Disregarding the delicate balance of power in Yemen by acting tactlessly , he alienated different groups within Yemeni society , causing them to forget their rivalries and unite against the Turks . Mahmud Pasha was displaced by Ridvan Pasha in 1564 . By 1565 , Yemen was split into two provinces , the highlands under the command of Ridvan Pasha and Tihama under Murad Pasha . Imam al - Mutahhar launched a propaganda campaign in which he claimed that prophet Mohammed came to him in a dream and advised him to wage jihad against the Ottomans . Al - Mutahhar led the tribes to capture Sana'a from Ridvan Pasha in 1567 . When Murad tried to relieve Sana'a , highland tribesmen ambushed his unit and slaughtered all of them . Over 80 battles were fought . The last decisive encounter took place in Dhamar around 1568 , in which Murad Pasha was beheaded and his head sent to al - Mutahhar in Sana'a . By 1568 , only Zabid remained under the possession of the Turks . Ruins of Thula fortress in ' Amran , where al - Mutahhar ibn Yahya barricaded himself against Ottoman attacks Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha , the Ottoman governor of Syria , was ordered by Selim II to suppress the Yemeni rebels . However , the Turkish army in Egypt was reluctant to go to Yemen due to their knowledge of the hegemony of the northern Yemenis . Mustafa Pasha sent a letter with two Turkish shawishes hoping to persuade al - Mutahhar to give an apology and confirm that Mustafa Pasha did not promote any act of aggression against the Ottoman army , and state that the `` ignorant Arabian '' according to the Turks , acted on their own . Imam al - Mutahhar refused the Ottoman offer . When Mustafa Pasha sent an expeditionary force under the command of Uthman Pasha , it was defeated with great casualties . Sultan Selim II was infuriated by Mustafa 's hesitation to go Yemen . He executed a number of sanjak - beys in Egypt and ordered Sinan Pasha to lead the entire Turkish army in Egypt to reconquer Yemen . Sinan Pasha was a prominent Ottoman general of Albanian origin . He reconquered Aden , Taiz , and Ibb , and besieged Shibam Kawkaban in 1570 for 7 months . The siege was lifted once a truce was reached . Imam al - Mutahhar was pushed back , but could not be entirely overcome . After al - Mutahhar 's demise in 1572 , the Zaydi community was not united under an imam ; the Turks took advantage of their disunity and conquered Sana'a , Sa'dah , and Najran in 1583 . Imam al - Nasir Hassan was arrested in 1585 and exiled to Constantinople , thereby putting an end to the Yemeni rebellion . The Zaydi tribesmen in the northern highlands particularly those of Hashid and Bakil , were ever the Turkish bugbear in all Arabia . The Ottomans who justified their presence in Yemen as a triumph for Islam , accused the Zaydis of being infidels . Hassan Pasha was appointed governor of Yemen and enjoyed a period of relative peace from 1585 to 1597 . Pupils of al - Mansur al - Qasim suggested he should claim the immamate and fight the Turks . He declined at first , but the promotion of the Hanafi school of jurisprudence at the expense of Zaydi Islam infuriated al - Mansur al - Qasim . He proclaimed the imamate in September 1597 , which was the same year the Ottoman authorities inaugurated al - Bakiriyya Mosque . By 1608 , Imam al - Mansur ( the victorious ) regained control over the highlands and signed a truce for 10 years with the Ottomans . Imam al - Mansur al - Qasim died in 1620 . His son Al - Mu'ayyad Muhammad succeeded him and confirmed the truce with the Ottomans . In 1627 , the Ottomans lost Aden and Lahej . ' Abdin Pasha was ordered to suppress the rebels , but failed , and had to retreat to Mocha . Al - Mu'ayyad Muhammad expelled the Ottomans from Sana'a in 1628 , only Zabid and Mocha remained under Ottoman possession . Al - Mu'ayyad Muhammad captured Zabid in 1634 and allowed the Ottomans to leave Mocha peacefully . The reason behind Al - Mu'ayyad Muhammad 's success was the possession of firearms by the tribes and their unity behind him . Mocha was Yemen 's busiest port in the 17th and 18th centuries . In 1632 , Al - Mu'ayyad Muhammad sent an expeditionary force of 1000 men to conquer Mecca . The army entered the city in triumph and killed its governor . The Ottomans were not ready to lose Mecca after Yemen , so they sent an army from Egypt to fight the Yemenites . Seeing that the Turkish army was too numerous to overcome , the Yemeni army retreated to a valley outside Mecca . Ottoman troops attacked the Yemenis by hiding at the wells that supplied them with water . This plan proceeded successfully , causing the Yemenis over 200 casualties , most from thirst . The tribesmen eventually surrendered and returned to Yemen . Al - Mu'ayyad Muhammad died in 1644 . He was succeeded by Al - Mutawakkil Isma'il , another son of al - Mansur al - Qasim , who conquered Yemen in its entirety , from Asir in the north to Dhofar in the east . During his reign , and during the reign of his successor , Al - Mahdi Ahmad ( 1676 -- 1681 ) , the imamate implemented some of the harshest discriminatory laws ( ghiyar ) against the Jews of Yemen , which culminated in the expulsion of all Jews ( Exile of Mawza ) to a hot and arid region in the Tihama coastal plain . The Qasimid state was the strongest Zaydi state to ever exist . During that period , Yemen was the sole coffee producer in the world . The country established diplomatic relations with the Safavid dynasty of Persia , Ottomans of Hejaz , Mughal Empire in India , and Ethiopia , as well . Fasilides of Ethiopia sent three diplomatic missions to Yemen , but the relations did not develop into political alliance , as Fasilides had hoped , due to the rise of powerful feudalists in his country . In the first half of the 18th century , the Europeans broke Yemen 's monopoly on coffee by smuggling coffee trees and cultivating them in their own colonies in the East Indies , East Africa , the West Indies , and Latin America . The imamate did not follow a cohesive mechanism for succession , and family quarrels and tribal insubordination led to the political decline of the Qasimi dynasty in the 18th century . In 1728 or 1731 , the chief representative of Lahej declared himself an independent sultan in defiance of the Qasimid dynasty and conquered Aden , thus establishing the Sultanate of Lahej . The rising power of the fervently Islamist Wahhabi movement on the Arabian Peninsula cost the Zaidi state its coastal possessions after 1803 . The imam was able to regain them temporarily in 1818 , but new intervention by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt in 1833 again wrested the coast from the ruler in Sana'a . After 1835 , the imamate changed hands with great frequency and some imams were assassinated . After 1849 , the Zaidi polity descended into chaos that lasted for decades .

The British were looking for a coal depot to service their steamers en route to India . It took 700 tons of coal for a round - trip from Suez to Bombay . East India Company officials decided on Aden . The British Empire tried to reach an agreement with the Zaydi imam of Sana'a , permitting them a foothold in Mocha , and when unable to secure their position , they extracted a similar agreement from the Sultan of Lahej , enabling them to consolidate a position in Aden . An incident played into British hands when , while passing Aden for trading purposes , one of their sailing ships sank and Arab tribesmen boarded it and plundered its contents . The British India government dispatched a warship under the command of Captain Stafford Bettesworth Haines to demand compensation . Haines bombarded Aden from his warship in January 1839 . The ruler of Lahej , who was in Aden at the time , ordered his guards to defend the port , but they failed in the face of overwhelming military and naval power . The British managed to occupy Aden and agreed to compensate the sultan with an annual payment of 6000 riyals . The British evicted the Sultan of Lahej from Aden and forced him to accept their `` protection . '' In November 1839 , 5000 tribesmen tried to retake the town , but were repulsed and 200 were killed . The British realized that Aden 's prosperity depended on their relations with the neighboring tribes , which required that they rest on a firm and satisfactory basis . The British government concluded `` protection and friendship '' treaties with nine tribes surrounding Aden , whereas they would remain independent from British interference in their affairs as long as they do not conclude treaties with foreigners ( non-Arab colonial powers ) . Aden was declared a free zone in 1850 . With emigrants from India , East Africa , and Southeast Asia , Aden grew into a world city . In 1850 , only 980 Arabs were registered as original inhabitants of the city . The English presence in Aden put them at odds with the Ottomans . The Turks asserted to the British that they held sovereignty over the whole of Arabia , including Yemen as successor of Mohammed and the chief of the universal caliphate . Ottoman return ( edit ) See also : Yemen Vilayet The Ottoman Grand Vizier and W\u0101li of Yemen Ahmed Muhtar Pasha The Ottomans were concerned about the British expansion from India to the Red Sea and Arabia . They returned to the Tihama in 1849 after an absence of two centuries . Rivalries and disturbances continued among the Zaydi imams , between them and their deputies , with the ulema , with the heads of tribes , as well as with those who belonged to other sects . Some citizens of Sana'a were desperate to return law and order to Yemen and asked the Ottoman Pasha in Tihama to pacify the country . Yemeni merchants knew that the return of the Ottomans would improve their trade , for the Ottomans would become their customers . An Ottoman expedition force tried to capture Sana'a , but was defeated and had to evacuate the highlands . The Opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 , strengthened the Ottoman decision to remain in Yemen . In 1872 , military forces were dispatched from Constantinople and moved beyond the Ottoman stronghold in the lowlands ( Tihama ) to conquer Sana'a . By 1873 , the Ottomans succeeded in conquering the northern highlands . Sana'a became the administrative capital of Yemen Vilayet . The Ottomans learned from their previous experience and worked on the disempowerment of local lords in the highland regions . They even attempted to secularize the Yemeni society , while Yemenite Jews came to perceive themselves in Yemeni nationalist terms . The Ottomans appeased the tribes by forgiving their rebellious chiefs and appointing them to administrative posts . They introduced a series of reforms to enhance the country 's economic welfare . However , corruption was widespread in the Ottoman administration in Yemen . This was because only the worst of the officials were appointed because those who could avoid serving in Yemen did so . The Ottomans had reasserted control over the highlands for temporary duration . The so - called Tanzimat reforms were considered heretic by the Zaydi tribes . In 1876 , the Hashid and Bakil tribes rebelled against the Ottomans ; the Turks had to appease them with gifts to end the uprising . The tribal chiefs were difficult to appease and an endless cycle of violence curbed Ottoman efforts to pacify the land . Ahmed Izzet Pasha proposed that the Ottoman army evacuate the highlands and confine itself to Tihama , and not unnecessarily burden itself with continuing military operation against the Zaydi tribes . The hit - and - run tactics of the northern highlands tribesmen wore out the Ottoman military . They resented the Turkish Tanzimat and defied all attempts to impose a central government upon them . The northern tribes united under the leadership of the House of Hamidaddin in 1890 . Imam Yahya Hamidaddin led a rebellion against the Turks in 1904 ; the rebels disrupted the Ottoman ability to govern . The revolts between 1904 and 1911 were especially damaging to the Ottomans , costing them as many as 10,000 soldiers and as much as 500,000 pounds per year . The Ottomans signed a treaty with imam Yahya Hamidaddin in 1911 . Under the treaty , Imam Yahya was recognized as an autonomous leader of the Zaydi northern highlands . The Ottomans continued to rule Shafi'i areas in the mid-south until their departure in 1918 . Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen ( edit ) Main article : Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen Imam Yahya hamid ed - Din 's house in Sana'a Imam Yahya hamid ed - Din al - Mutawakkil was ruling the northern highlands independently from 1911 . After the Ottoman departure in 1918 , he sought to recapture the lands of his Qasimid ancestors . He dreamed of Greater Yemen stretching from Asir to Dhofar . These schemes brought him into conflict with the de facto rulers in the territories claimed , namely the Idrsids , Ibn Saud , and the British government in Aden . The Zaydi imam did not recognize the Anglo - Ottoman border agreement of 1905 on the grounds that it was made between two foreign powers occupying Yemen . The border treaty effectively divided Yemen into north and south . In 1915 , the British signed a treaty with the Idrsids guaranteeing their security and independence if they would fight against the Turks . In 1919 , Imam Yahya hamid ed - Din moved southward to `` liberate '' the nine British protectorates . The British responded by moving quickly towards Tihama and occupying al - Hudaydah . Then they handed it over to their Idrisi allies . Imam Yahya attacked the southern protectorates again in 1922 . The British bombed Yahya 's tribal forces using aircraft to which the tribes had no effective counter . In 1925 , Imam Yahya captured al - Hudaydah from the Idrsids . He continued to follow and attack the Idrsids until Asir fell under the control of the imam 's forces , forcing the Idrisi to request an agreement that would enable them to administer the region in the name of the imam . Imam Yahya refused the offer on the grounds that the Idrisis were of a Moroccan descent . According to Imam Yahya , the Idrisis , along with the British , were nothing but recent intruders and should be driven out of Yemen permanently . In 1927 , Imam Yahya 's forces were 50 km away from Aden , Taiz , and Ibb , and were bombed by the British for five days ; the imam had to pull back . Small Bedouin forces , mainly from the Madh'hij confederation of Marib , attacked Shabwah but were bombed by the British and had to retreat . British colony of Aden : Queen Elizabeth II stamp , 1953 The Italian Empire was the first to recognize Imam Yahya as the King of Yemen in 1926 . This created a great deal of anxiety for the British , who interpreted it as recognition of Imam Yahya 's claim to sovereignty over Greater Yemen , which included the Aden protectorate and Asir . The idrisis turned to Ibn Saud seeking his protection from Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed - Din . However , in 1932 , the Idrisis broke their accord with Ibn Saud and went back to Imam Yahya seeking help against Ibn Saud himself , who had begun liquidating their authority and expressed his desire to annex those territories into his own Saudi domain . Imam Yahya demanded the return of all Idrisi dominion . That same year , a group of Hejazi liberals fled to Yemen and plotted to expel Ibn Saud from the former Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz , which had been conquered by the Saudis seven years earlier . Ibn Saud appealed to Britain for aid . The British government sent arms and aeroplanes . The British were anxious that Ibn Saud 's financial difficulties may encourage the Italian Empire to bail him out . Ibn Saud suppressed the Asiri rebellion in 1933 , after which the Idrsids fled to Sana'a . Negotiations between the Imam Yahya Hamid ed - Din and Ibn Saud proved fruitless . After a military confrontation , Ibn Saud announced a ceasefire in May 1934 . Imam Yahya agreed to release Saudi hostages and the surrender of the Idrisis to Saudi custody . Imam Yahya ceded the three provinces of Najran , Asir , and Jazan for 20 years . and signed another treaty with the British government in 1934 . The imam recognized the British sovereignty over Aden protectorate for 40 years . Out of fear for Hudaydah , Yahya did submit to these demands . According to Bernard Reich , Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at George Washington University , Yahya could have done better by reorganizing the Zaydi tribes of the northern highlands as his ancestors did against the Turks and British intruders and turn the lands they captured into another graveyard . Colonial Aden ( edit ) Queen Elizabeth II holding a sword prepared to knight subjects in Aden in 1954 Starting in 1890 , hundreds of Yemeni people from Hajz , Al - Baetha , and Taiz migrated to Aden to work at ports and as laborers . This helped the population of Aden once again become predominantly Arab after , having been declared a free zone , it had become mostly foreigners . During World War II , Aden had increasing economic growth and became the second - busiest port in the world after New York City . After the rise of labour unions , a rift was apparent between the sectors of workers and the first signs of resistance to the occupation started in 1943 . Muhammed Ali Luqman founded the first Arabic club and first Arabic school in Aden and was the first to start working towards a union . The Colony of Aden was divided into an eastern colony and a western colony . Those were further divided into 23 sultanates and emirates , and several independent tribes that had no relationships with the sultanates . The deal between the sultanates and Britain detailed protection and complete control of foreign relations by the British . The Sultanate of Lahej was the only one in which the sultan was referred to as His Highness . The Federation of South Arabia was created by the British to counter Arab nationalism by giving more freedom to the rulers of the nations . The North Yemen Civil War inspired many in the south to rise against the British rule . The National Liberation Front ( NLO ) of Yemen was formed with the leadership of Qahtan Muhammad Al - Shaabi . The NLO hoped to destroy all the sultanates and eventually unite with the Yemen Arab Republic . Most of the support for the NLO came from Radfan and Yafa , so the British launched Operation Nutcracker , which completely burned Radfan in January 1964 . Two States ( edit ) Main articles : North Yemen and South Yemen Egyptian military intervention in North Yemen in 1962 Arab nationalism made an impact in some circles who opposed the lack of modernization efforts in the Mutawakkilite monarchy . This became apparent when Imam Ahmad bin Yahya died in 1962 . He was succeeded by his son , but army officers attempted to seize power , sparking the North Yemen Civil War . The Hamidaddin royalists were supported by Saudi Arabia , Britain , and Jordan ( mostly with weapons and financial aid , but also with small military forces ) , whilst the military rebels were backed by Egypt . Egypt provided the rebels with weapons and financial assistance , but also sent a large military force to participate in the fighting . Israel covertly supplied weapons to the royalists to keep the Egyptian military busy in Yemen and make Nasser less likely to initiate a conflict in the Sinai . After six years of civil war , the military rebels were victorious ( February 1968 ) and formed the Yemen Arab Republic . The revolution in the north coincided with the Aden Emergency , which hastened the end of British rule in the south . On 30 November 1967 , the state of South Yemen was formed , comprising Aden and the former Protectorate of South Arabia . This socialist state was later officially known as the People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen and a programme of nationalisation was begun . British Army 's counter-insurgency campaign in the British controlled territories of South Arabia , 1967 Relations between the two Yemeni states fluctuated between peaceful and hostile . The South was supported by the Eastern bloc . The North , however , was not able to get the same connections . In 1972 , the two states fought a war . The war was resolved with a ceasefire and negotiations brokered by the Arab League , where it was declared that unification would eventually occur . In 1978 , Ali Abdallah Saleh was named as president of the Yemen Arab Republic . After the war , the North complained about the South 's help from foreign countries . This included Saudi Arabia . In 1979 , fresh fighting between the two states resumed and efforts were renewed to bring about unification . North Yemen ( in orange ) and Marxist South Yemen ( in blue ) before 1990 Thousands were killed in 1986 in the South Yemen Civil War . President Ali Nasser Muhammad fled to the north and was later sentenced to death for treason . A new government formed . Unification and civil war ( edit ) Main article : Yemeni unification In 1990 , the two governments reached a full agreement on the joint governing of Yemen , and the countries were merged on 22 May 1990 , with Saleh as President . The President of South Yemen , Ali Salim al - Beidh , became Vice President . A unified parliament was formed and a unity constitution was agreed upon . In the 1993 parliamentary election , the first held after unification , the General People 's Congress won 122 of 301 seats . After the invasion of Kuwait crisis in 1990 , Yemen 's president opposed military intervention from non-Arab states . As a member of the United Nations Security Council for 1990 and 1991 , Yemen abstained on a number of UNSC resolutions concerning Iraq and Kuwait and voted against the `` ... use of force resolution . '' The vote outraged the U.S. Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000 Yemenis in 1990 and 1991 to punish Yemen for its opposition to the intervention . Following food riots in major towns in 1992 , a new coalition government made up of the ruling parties from both the former Yemeni states was formed in 1993 . However , Vice President al - Beidh withdrew to Aden in August 1993 and said he would not return to the government until his grievances were addressed . These included northern violence against his Yemeni Socialist Party , as well as the economic marginalization of the south . Negotiations to end the political deadlock dragged on into 1994 . The government of Prime Minister Haydar Abu Bakr Al - Attas became ineffective due to political infighting An accord between northern and southern leaders was signed in Amman , Jordan on 20 February 1994 , but this could not stop the civil war . During these tensions , both the northern and southern armies ( which had never integrated ) gathered on their respective frontiers . The May -- July 1994 civil war in Yemen resulted in the defeat of the southern armed forces and the flight into exile of many Yemeni Socialist Party leaders and other southern secessionists . Saudi Arabia actively aided the south during the 1994 civil war . Contemporary Yemen ( edit ) Prayers during Ramadan in Sana'a Saleh became Yemen 's first directly elected president in the 1999 presidential election , winning 96.2 % of the vote . The only other candidate , Najeeb Qahtan Al - Sha'abi , was the son of Qahtan Muhammad al - Shaabi , a former president of South Yemen . Though a member of Saleh 's General People 's Congress ( GPC ) party , Najeeb ran as an independent . In October 2000 , 17 U.S. personnel died after a suicide attack on the U.S. naval vessel USS Cole in Aden , which was subsequently blamed on al - Qaeda . After the September 11 attacks on the United States , President Saleh assured U.S. President George W. Bush that Yemen was a partner in his War on Terror . In 2001 , violence surrounded a referendum , which apparently supported extending Saleh 's rule and powers . The Shia insurgency in Yemen began in June 2004 when dissident cleric Hussein Badreddin al - Houthi , head of the Zaidi Shia sect , launched an uprising against the Yemeni government . The Yemeni government alleged that the Houthis were seeking to overthrow it and to implement Sh\u012b'a religious law . The rebels counter that they are `` defending their community against discrimination '' and government aggression . `` Sana'a risks becoming the first capital in the world to run out of a viable water supply as Yemen 's streams and natural aquifers run dry , '' says The Guardian . In 2005 , at least 36 people were killed in clashes across the country between police and protesters over rising fuel prices . In the 2006 presidential election , held on 20 September , Saleh won with 77.2 % of the vote . His main rival , Faisal bin Shamlan , received 21.8 % . Saleh was sworn in for another term on 27 September . A suicide bomber killed eight Spanish tourists and two Yemenis in the province of Marib in July 2007 . A series of bomb attacks occurred on police , official , diplomatic , foreign business , and tourism targets in 2008 . Car bombings outside the U.S. embassy in Sana'a killed 18 people , including six of the assailants in September 2008 . In 2008 , an opposition rally in Sana'a demanding electoral reform was met with police gunfire . Al Qaeda ( edit ) In January 2009 , the Saudi Arabian and Yemeni al - Qaeda branches merged to form Al - Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , which is based in Yemen , and many of its members were Saudi nationals who had been released from Guantanamo Bay . Saleh released 176 al - Qaeda suspects on condition of good behaviour , but terrorist activities continued . The Yemeni army launched a fresh offensive against the Shia insurgents in 2009 , assisted by Saudi forces . Tens of thousands of people were displaced by the fighting . A new ceasefire was agreed upon in February 2010 . However , by the end of the year , Yemen claimed that 3,000 soldiers had been killed in renewed fighting . The Shia rebels accused Saudi Arabia of providing support to salafi groups to suppress Zaidism in Yemen . Some news reports have suggested that , on orders from U.S. President Barack Obama , U.S. warplanes fired cruise missiles at what officials in Washington claimed were Al Qaeda training camps in the provinces of Sana'a and Abyan on 17 December 2009 . Instead of hitting Al - Qaeda operatives , it hit a village , killing 55 civilians . Officials in Yemen said that the attacks claimed the lives of more than 60 civilians , 28 of them children . Another airstrike was carried out on 24 December . The U.S. launched a series of drone attacks in Yemen to curb a perceived growing terror threat due to political chaos in Yemen . Since December 2009 , U.S. strikes in Yemen have been carried out by the U.S. military with intelligence support from the CIA . The drone strikes are protested by human - rights groups who say they kill innocent civilians and that the U.S. military and CIA drone strikes lack sufficient congressional oversight , including the choice of human targets suspected of being threats to America . Controversy over U.S. policy for drone attacks mushroomed after a September 2011 drone strike in Yemen killed Anwar al - Awlaki and Samir Khan , both U.S. citizens . Another drone strike in October 2011 killed Anwar 's teenaged son , Abdulrahman al - Awlaki . In 2010 , the Obama administration policy allowed targeting of people whose names are not known . The U.S. government increased military aid to $140 million in 2010 . U.S. drone strikes continued after the ousting of President Saleh . As of 2015 , Shi'a Houthis are fighting against the Islamic State , Al Qaeda , and Saudi Arabia . U.S. supports the Saudi - led military intervention in Yemen against the Houthis , but many in US SOCOM reportedly favor Houthis , as they have been an effective force to roll back al - Qaeda and recently ISIL in Yemen . The Guardian reported that `` The only groups poised to benefit from the war dragging on are the jihadis of Islamic State ( ISIL ) and al - Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , the latter 's most powerful franchise , who are likely to gain influence amid the chaos . ISIL has claimed recent , bloody suicide bombings in Houthi mosques and Sana'a when it once had no known presence in the country , while AQAP has continued to seize territory in eastern Yemen unhindered by American drone strikes . '' In February 2016 Al - Qaeda forces and Saudi - led coalition forces were both seen fighting Houthi rebels in the same battle . Revolution and aftermath ( edit ) Main articles : 2011 Yemeni revolution , 2014 -- 15 Yemeni coup d'\u00e9tat , Yemeni civil war ( 2015 -- present ) , Saudi Arabian - led intervention in Yemen , and Famine in Yemen Protest in Sana'a , 3 February 2011 Controlled by Houthis and Saleh loyalists Controlled by Hadi loyalists Controlled by al - Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - affiliated Ansar al - Sharia The 2011 Yemeni revolution followed other Arab Spring mass protests in early 2011 . The uprising was initially against unemployment , economic conditions , and corruption , as well as against the government 's proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen so that Saleh 's son could inherit the presidency . In March 2011 , police snipers opened fire on the prodemocracy camp in Sana'a , killing more than 50 people . In May , dozens were killed in clashes between troops and tribal fighters in Sana'a . By this point , Saleh began to lose international support . In October 2011 , Yemeni human rights activist Tawakul Karman won the Nobel Peace Prize , and the UN Security Council condemned the violence and called for a transfer of power . On 23 November 2011 , Saleh flew to Riyadh , in neighbouring Saudi Arabia , to sign the Gulf Co-operation Council plan for political transition , which he had previously spurned . Upon signing the document , he agreed to legally transfer the office and powers of the presidency to his deputy , Vice President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi . Hadi took office for a two - year term upon winning the uncontested presidential elections in February 2012 . A unity government -- including a prime minister from the opposition -- was formed . Al - Hadi will oversee the drafting of a new constitution , followed by parliamentary and presidential elections in 2014 . Saleh returned in February 2012 . In the face of objections from thousands of street protesters , parliament granted him full immunity from prosecution . Saleh 's son , General Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh , continues to exercise a strong hold on sections of the military and security forces . AQAP claimed responsibility for a February 2012 suicide attack on the presidential palace that killed 26 Republican Guards on the day that President Hadi was sworn in . AQAP was also behind a suicide bombing that killed 96 soldiers in Sana'a three months later . In September 2012 , a car bomb attack in Sana'a killed 11 people , a day after a local al - Qaeda leader Said al - Shihri was reported killed in the south . By 2012 , there has been a `` small contingent of U.S. special - operations troops '' -- in addition to CIA and `` unofficially acknowledged '' U.S. military presence -- in response to increasing terror attacks by AQAP on Yemeni citizens . Many analysts have pointed out the former Yemeni government role in cultivating terrorist activity in the country . Following the election of new president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi , the Yemeni military was able to push Ansar al - Sharia back and recapture the Shabwah Governorate . Saudi - led air strike on Sana'a , 12 June 2015 : Saudi Arabia is operating without a UN mandate . The central government in Sana'a remained weak , staving off challenges from southern separatists and Shia rebels as well as AQAP . The Shia insurgency intensified after Hadi took power , escalating in September 2014 as anti-government forces led by Abdul - Malik al - Houthi swept into the capital and forced Hadi to agree to a `` unity '' government . The Houthis then refused to participate in the government , although they continued to apply pressure on Hadi and his ministers , even shelling the president 's private residence and placing him under house arrest , until the government 's mass resignation in January 2015 . The following month , the Houthis dissolved parliament and declared that a Revolutionary Committee under Mohammed Ali al - Houthi was the interim authority in Yemen . Abdul - Malik al - Houthi , a cousin of the new acting president , called the takeover a `` glorious revolution . '' However , the `` constitutional declaration '' of 6 February 2015 was widely rejected by opposition politicians and foreign governments , including the United Nations . Hadi managed to flee from Sana'a to Aden , his hometown and stronghold in the south , on 21 February . He promptly gave a televised speech rescinding his resignation , condemning the coup , and calling for recognition as the constitutional president of Yemen . The following month , Hadi declared Aden Yemen 's `` temporary '' capital . The Houthis , however , rebuffed an initiative by the Gulf Cooperation Council and continued to move south toward Aden . All U.S. personnel were evacuated and President Hadi was forced to flee the country to Saudi Arabia . On 26 March , Saudi Arabia announced operation al - Hazm Storm and began airstrikes and announced its intentions to lead a military coalition against the Houthis , whom they claimed were being aided by Iran , and began a force buildup along the Yemeni border . The coalition included the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain , Jordan , Morocco , Sudan , Egypt , and Pakistan . The United States announced that it was assisting with intelligence , targeting , and logistics . Saudi Arabia and Egypt would not rule out ground operations . After Hadi troops took control of Aden from Houthis , jihadist groups are active in the city , and some of terrorist incidents were linked to it such as Missionaries of Charity attack in Aden in 4 March 2016 . Geography ( edit ) Main article : Geography of Yemen A Haraaz landscape , Yemen A topographic map of Yemen Mountains of north Yemen Yemen is in Western Asia , in the southern half of the Arabian Peninsula , bordering the Arabian Sea , Gulf of Aden , and the Red Sea . It lies south of Saudi Arabia and west of Oman , between latitudes 12 and 19 \u00b0 N and longitudes 42 and 55 \u00b0 E. Yemen is at 15 \u00b0 N 48 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ \ufeff 15 \u00b0 N 48 \u00b0 E \ufeff \/ 15 ; 48 . Yemen is 527,970 km ( 203,850 sq mi ) in size . A number of Red Sea islands , including the Hanish Islands , Kamaran , and Perim , as well as Socotra in the Arabian Sea , belong to Yemen . Many of the islands are volcanic ; for example Jabal al - Tair had a volcanic eruption in 2007 and before that in 1883 . Yemen is a transcontinental country . Regions and Climate ( edit ) A water reservoir in Haraz , Yemen Yemen can be divided geographically into four main regions : the coastal plains in the west , the western highlands , the eastern highlands , and the Rub al Khali in the east . The Tihamah ( `` hot lands '' or `` hot earth '' ) form a very arid and flat coastal plain along Yemen 's entire Red Sea coastline . Despite the aridity , the presence of many lagoons makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for malaria mosquitos . Extensive crescent - shaped sand dunes are present . The evaporation in the Tihamah is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea , but they do contribute to extensive groundwater reserves . Today , these are heavily exploited for agricultural use . Near the village of Madar about 50 km ( 30 mi ) north of Sana'a , dinosaur footprints were found , indicating that the area was once a muddy flat . The Tihamah ends abruptly at the escarpment of the western highlands . This area , now heavily terraced to meet the demand for food , receives the highest rainfall in Arabia , rapidly increasing from 100 mm ( 3.9 in ) per year to about 760 mm ( 29.9 in ) in Taiz and over 1,000 mm ( 39.4 in ) in Ibb . Temperatures are hot in the day , but fall dramatically at night . Perennial streams occur in the highlands , but these never reach the sea because of high evaporation in the Tihamah . The central highlands are an extensive high plateau over 2,000 m ( 6,562 ft ) in elevation . This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain - shadow influences , but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping . Water storage allows for irrigation and the growing of wheat and barley . Sana'a is in this region . The highest point in Yemen is Jabal an Nabi Shu'ayb , at 3,666 m ( 12,028 ft ) . Yemen 's portion of the Rub al Khali desert in the east is much lower , generally below 1,000 m ( 3,281 ft ) , and receives almost no rain . It is populated only by Bedouin herders of camels . The growing scarcity of water is a source of increasing international concern . See Water supply and sanitation in Yemen . Biodiversity ( edit ) Main article : Wildlife of Yemen Dracaena cinnabari at Socotra Island The flora of Yemen is a mixture of the tropical African , Sudanian plant geographical region and the Saharo - Arabian region . The Sudanian element -- characterized by relatively high rainfall -- dominates the western mountains and parts of the highland plains . The Saharo - Arabian element dominates in the coastal plains , eastern mountain , and the eastern and northern desert plains . A high percentage of Yemen plants belong to tropical African plants of Sudanian regions . Among the Sudanian element species , the following may be mentioned : Ficus spp. , Acacia mellifera , Grewia villosa , Commiphora spp. , Rosa abyssinica , Cadaba farinosa and others . Among the Saharo - Arabian species , these may be mentioned : Panicum turgidum , Aerva javanica , Zygophyllum simplex , Fagonia indica , Salsola spp. , Acacia tortilis , A. hamulos , A. ehrenbergiana , Phoenix dactylifera , Hyphaene thebaica , Capparis decidua , Salvadora persica , Balanites aegyptiaca , and many others . Many of the Saharo - Arabian species are endemic to the extensive sandy coastal plain ( the Tihamah ) . The characteristic genera of the Irano - Turanian in the eastern and northern east of the country are : Calligonum spp. , Cymbopogon jwarancusa , and Tamarix spp. and of the Mediterranean regions are : Teucrium , Lavandula , Juniperus , Brassica , and Diplotaxis spp . Politics ( edit ) Main article : Politics of Yemen The Yemeni government has been driven in two since 2014 , when a Shia group known as the Houthis seized control of the capital Sana'a . After months of tense coexistence , the Houthis made a constitutional declaration in early 2015 that placed them in de facto control of the government . President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi fled the capital to the southern city of Aden , former capital of South Yemen , and eventually evacuated to Saudi Arabia . With the support of the Saudis and other Gulf states , Hadi remains the official leader of a provisional government based in Aden . The Houthis have struggled to achieve international legitimacy , with most countries continuing to recognize Hadi as Yemen 's president , despite the formation of a `` national salvation '' government in 2016 without the cooperation of the Hadi administration . De jure , Yemen is a republic with a bicameral legislature . Under the 1991 constitution , an elected President , an elected 301 - seat Assembly of Representatives , and an appointed 111 - member Shura Council share power . The President is the head of state , and the Prime Minister is the head of government . In Sana'a , a Supreme Political Council ( not recognized internationally ) forms the government . The 1991 constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by at least 15 members of the Parliament . The prime minister , in turn , is appointed by the president and must be approved by two - thirds of the Parliament . The presidential term of office is seven years , and the parliamentary term of elected office is six years . Suffrage is universal for people age 18 and older , but only Muslims may hold elected office . President Ali Abdullah Saleh became the first elected president in reunified Yemen in 1999 ( though he had been president of unified Yemen since 1990 and president of North Yemen since 1978 ) . He was re-elected to office in September 2006 . Saleh 's victory was marked by an election that international observers judged was `` partly free , '' though the election was accompanied by violence , violations of press freedoms , and allegations of fraud . Parliamentary elections were held in April 2003 , and the General People 's Congress maintained an absolute majority . Saleh remained almost uncontested in his seat of power until 2011 , when local frustration at his refusal to hold another round of elections , as combined with the impact of the 2011 Arab Spring , resulted in mass protests . In 2012 , he was forced to resign from power , though he remains an important actor in Yemeni politics , allying with the Houthis during their takeover in the mid-2010s . The constitution calls for an independent judiciary . The former northern and southern legal codes have been unified . The legal system includes separate commercial courts and a Supreme Court based in Sana'a . Sharia is the main source of laws , with many court cases being debated according to the religious basis of law and many judges being religious scholars as well as legal authorities . The Prison Authority Organization Act , Republican decree no . 48 ( 1981 ) , and Prison Act regulations , provide the legal framework for management of the country 's prison system . Foreign relations ( edit ) Main article : Foreign relations of Yemen Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh at the Pentagon , 8 June 2004 The geography and ruling imams of North Yemen kept the country isolated from foreign influence before 1962 . The country 's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the Taif Agreement of 1934 , which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse . The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20 - year increments , and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995 . Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense . The Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-Muslim presences in North Yemen . Following the September 1962 revolution , the Yemen Arab Republic became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt . Saudi Arabia aided the royalists in their attempt to defeat the Republicans and did not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic until 1970 . At the same time , Saudi Arabia maintained direct contact with Yemeni tribes , which sometimes strained its official relations with the Yemeni Government . Saudi Arabia remained hostile to any form of political and social reform in Yemen and continued to provide financial support for tribal elites . In February 1989 , North Yemen joined Iraq , Jordan , and Egypt in forming the Arab Cooperation Council ( ACC ) , an organization created partly in response to the founding of the Gulf Cooperation Council and intended to foster closer economic cooperation and integration among its members . After unification , the Republic of Yemen was accepted as a member of the ACC in place of its YAR predecessor . In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis , the ACC has remained inactive . Yemen is not a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council mainly for its republican government . Yemen is a member of the United Nations , the Arab League , and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , and also participates in the nonaligned movement . The Republic of Yemen accepted responsibility for all treaties and debts of its predecessors , the Yemen Arab Republic ( YAR ) and the People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen ( PDRY ) . Yemen has acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . Ousted Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry , 7 May 2015 Since the end of the 1994 civil war , tangible progress has been made on the diplomatic front in restoring normal relations with Yemen 's neighbors . In the summer of 2000 , Yemen and Saudi Arabia signed an International Border Treaty settling a 50 - year - old dispute over the location of the border between the two countries . Until the signing of the Yemen - Saudi Arabia peace treaty in July 2000 , Yemen 's northern border was undefined ; the Arabian Desert prevented any human habitation there . Yemen settled its dispute with Eritrea over the Hanish Islands in 1998 . The Saudi -- Yemen barrier was constructed by Saudi Arabia against an influx of illegal immigrants and against the smuggling of drugs and weapons . The Independent headed an article with `` Saudi Arabia , one of the most vocal critics in the Arab world of Israel 's `` security fence '' in the West Bank , is quietly emulating the Israeli example by erecting a barrier along its porous border with Yemen . '' Human Rights ( edit ) Main article : Human rights in Yemen The government and its security forces , often considered to suffer from rampant corruption , have been responsible for torture , inhumane treatment , and extrajudicial executions . There are arbitrary arrests of citizens , especially in the south , as well as arbitrary searches of homes . Prolonged pretrial detention is a serious problem , and judicial corruption , inefficiency , and executive interference undermine due process . Freedom of speech , the press , and religion are all restricted . Journalists critical of the government are often harassed and threatened by the police . Homosexuality is illegal , punishable by death . Since the start of the Shia insurgency , many people accused of supporting Al - Houthi have been arrested and held without charge or trial . According to the U.S. State Department International Religious Freedom Report 2007 , `` Some Zaydis reported harassment and discrimination by the Government because they were suspected of sympathizing with the al - Houthis . However , it appears the Government 's actions against the group were probably politically , not religiously , motivated . '' The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants reported several violations of refugee and asylum seekers ' rights in the organization 's 2008 World Refugee Survey . Yemeni authorities reportedly deported numerous foreigners without giving them access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , despite the UN 's repeated requests . Refugees further reported violence directed against them by Yemeni authorities while living in refugee camps . Yemeni officials reportedly raped and beat camp - based refugees with impunity in 2007 . Yemen is ranked last of 135 countries in the 2012 Global Gender Gap Report . Human Rights Watch reported on discrimination and violence against women as well as on the abolition of the minimum marriage age of fifteen for women . The onset of puberty ( interpreted by some to be as low as the age of nine ) was set as a requirement for marriage instead . Publicity about the case of ten - year - old Yemeni divorcee Nujood Ali brought the child marriage issue to the fore not only in Yemen but also worldwide . Human Trafficking ( edit ) Main article : Human trafficking in Yemen The United States Department of State 2013 Trafficking in Persons report classified Yemen as a Tier 3 country , meaning that its government does not fully comply with the minimum standards against human trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so . Yemen officially abolished slavery in 1962 , but it is still being practiced . Military ( edit ) Main article : Military of Yemen Yemeni soldiers The armed forces of Yemen include the Yemen Army ( includes Republican Guard ) , Navy ( includes Marines ) , Yemeni Air Force ( Al Quwwat al Jawwiya al Yamaniya ; includes Air Defense Force ) . A major reorganization of the armed forces continues . The unified air forces and air defenses are now under one command . The navy has concentration in Aden . Total armed forces manning numbers about 401,000 active personnel , including moreover especially conscripts . The Yemen Arab Republic and The People 's Democratic Republic of Yemen joined to form the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 . The supreme commander of the armed forces is the President of the Republic of Yemen . The number of military personnel in Yemen is relatively high ; in sum , Yemen has the second largest military force on the Arabian Peninsula after Saudi Arabia . In 2012 total active troops were estimated as follows : army , 390,000 ; navy , 7,000 ; and air force , 5,000 . In September 2007 , the government announced the reinstatement of compulsory military service . Yemen 's defense budget , which in 2006 represented approximately 40 percent of the total government budget , is expected to remain high for the near term , as the military draft takes effect and internal security threats continue to escalate . By 2012 Yemen had 401,000 active personnel . Administrative divisions ( edit ) Main article : Governorates of Yemen Governorates of Yemen As of the end of 2004 , Yemen was divided into twenty governorates ( muhafazat -- the latest being Raymah Governorate , which was created during 2004 ) plus one municipality called `` Amanat Al - Asemah '' ( the latter containing the constitutional capital , Sana'a ) . An additional governorate ( Soqatra Governorate ) was created in December 2013 comprising Socotra Island ( bottom - right corner of map ) , previously part of Hadramaut Governorate . The governorates are subdivided into 333 districts ( muderiah ) , which are subdivided into 2,210 sub-districts , and then into 38,284 villages ( as of 2001 ) . In 2014 , a constitutional panel decided to divide the country into six regions -- four in the north , two in the south , and capital Sana'a outside of any region -- creating a federalist model of governance . This federal proposal was a contributing factor toward the Houthis ' subsequent coup d'\u00e9tat against the government .

Services are the largest economic sector ( 61.4 % of GDP ) , followed by the industrial sector ( 30.9 % ) , and agriculture ( 7.7 % ) . Of these , petroleum production represents around 25 % of GDP and 63 % of the government 's revenue . Agriculture ( edit ) Agriculture previously represented 18 -- 27 % of the GDP , but its apportionment began changing due to emigration of rural labor , and structural changes within the sector . Principal agricultural commodities produced in the nation include grain , vegetables , fruits , pulses , qat , coffee , cotton , dairy products , fish , livestock ( sheep , goats , cattle , camels ) , and poultry . A coffee plantation in North Yemen Most Yemenis are employed in agriculture . Sorghum is the most common crop . Cotton and many fruit trees are also grown , with mangoes being the most valuable . A big problem in Yemen is the cultivation of Khat , a psychoactive plant that releases a stimulant when chewed , and accounts for up to 40 percent of the water drawn from the Sana'a Basin each year , and that figure is rising . Some agricultural practices are drying the Sana'a Basin and displaced vital crops , which has resulted in increasing food prices . Rising food prices , in turn , pushed an additional six percent of the country into poverty in 2008 alone . Efforts are being made by the Government and Dawoodi Bohra community at North Yemen to replace qat with coffee plantations . Industry ( edit ) Yemen 's industrial sector is centered on crude oil production and petroleum refining , food processing , handicrafts , small - scale production of cotton textiles and leather goods , aluminum products , commercial ship repair , cement , and natural gas production . As of 2013 , Yemen had an industrial production growth rate of 4.8 % . It also has large proven reserves of natural gas . Yemen 's first liquified natural gas plant began production in October 2009 . Labor force ( edit ) A Souq in Old Sana'a The labor force was 7 million workers in 2013 . Services , industry , construction and commerce together constitute less than 25 % of the labor force . The unemployment rate as of 2003 was 35 % . Export and import ( edit ) As of 2013 , exports from Yemen totaled $6.694 billion . The main export commodities are crude oil , coffee , dried and salted fish , liquefied natural gas . These products were mainly sent to China ( 41 % ) , Thailand ( 19.2 % ) , India ( 11.4 % ) , and South Korea ( 4.4 % ) . Imports as of 2013 total $10.97 billion . The main imported commodities are machinery and equipment , foodstuffs , livestock , and chemicals . These products were mainly imported from the EU ( 48.8 % ) , UAE ( 9.8 % ) , Switzerland ( 8.8 % ) , China ( 7.4 % ) , and India ( 5.8 % ) . State budget ( edit ) Drilling for oil in Yemen using a land rig As of 2013 , the Yemeni government 's budget consisted of $7.769 billion in revenues and $12.31 billion in expenditures . Taxes and other revenues constituted roughly 17.7 % of the GDP , with a budget deficit of 10.3 % . The public debt was 47.1 % of GDP . Yemen had reserves of foreign exchange and gold of around $5.538 billion in 2013 . Its inflation rate over the same period based on consumer prices was 11.8 % . Yemen 's external debt totaled $7.806 billion . International relations ( edit ) Beginning in the mid-1950s , the Soviet Union and China provided large - scale assistance . For example , China and the United States are involved with the expansion of the Sana'a International Airport . In the south , pre-independence economic activity was overwhelmingly concentrated in the port city of Aden . The seaborne transit trade , which the port relied upon , collapsed with the closure of the Suez Canal and Britain 's withdrawal from Aden in 1967 . Since the conclusion of the war , the government made an agreement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) to implement a structural adjustment program . Phase one of the program included major financial and monetary reforms , including floating the currency , reducing the budget deficit , and cutting subsidies . Phase two addresses structural issues , such as civil service reform . In early 1995 , the government of Yemen launched an economic , financial , and administrative reform program ( EFARP ) with the support of the World Bank and the IMF , as well as international donors . These programs had a positive impact on Yemen 's economy and led to the reduction of the budget deficit to less than 3 % of gross domestic product during the period 1995 -- 1999 and the correction of macro-financial imbalances . The real growth rate in the non-oil sector rose by 5.6 % from 1995 to 1997 . Water supply and sanitation ( edit ) Main article : Water supply and sanitation in Yemen A key challenge is severe water scarcity , especially in the Highlands , prompting The Times to write `` Yemen could become first nation to run out of water . '' A second key challenge is a high level of poverty , making it difficult to recover the costs of service provision . Access to water supply sanitation is as low as in some sub-Saharan African countries . Yemen is both the poorest country and the most water - scarce country in the Arab world . Third , the capacity of sector institutions to plan , build , operate and maintain infrastructure remains limited . Last but not least the security situation makes it even more difficult to improve or even maintain existing levels of service . The average Yemeni has access to only 140 cubic meters of water per year ( 101 gallons per day ) for all uses , while the Middle Eastern average is 1000 m \/ yr , and the internationally defined threshold for water stress is 1700 cubic meters per year . Yemen 's groundwater is the main source of water in the country but the water tables have dropped severely leaving Yemen without a viable source of water . For example , in Sana'a , the water table was 30 meters below surface in the 1970s but had dropped to 1200 meters below surface by 2012 . The groundwater has not been regulated by Yemen 's governments . Even before the revolution , Yemen 's water situation had been described as increasingly dire by experts who worried that Yemen would be the first country to run out of water . Agriculture in Yemen takes up about 90 % of water in Yemen even though it only generates 6 % of GDP . A large portion of Yemenis are dependent on small - scale subsistence agriculture . Half of agricultural water in Yemen is used to grow khat , a drug that many Yemenis chew . This means that in such a water - scarce country as Yemen , where half the population is food - insecure , 45 % of the water withdrawn from the ever - depleting aquifers is used to grow a crop that feeds nobody . Due to the 2015 Yemeni Civil War , the situation is increasingly dire . 80 % of Yemen 's population struggles to access water to drink and bathe . Bombing has forced many Yemenis to leave their homes for other areas , and so wells in those areas are under increasing pressure . Demographics ( edit ) Main article : Demographics of Yemen Yemen 's population ( 1961 -- 2008 ) . Yemen has a growth rate of 3.46 % ( 2008 est . ) Yemen 's population is 28 million by 2016 estimates , with 46 % of the population being under 15 years old and 2.7 % above 65 years . In 1950 , it was 4.3 million . By 2050 , the population is estimated to increase to about 60 million . Yemen has a high total fertility rate , at 4.45 children per woman . It is the 30th highest in the world . Sana'a 's population has increased rapidly , from roughly 55,000 in 1978 to nearly 2 million in the early 21st century . Ethnic groups ( edit ) Yemen 's tribal areas and Shia \/ Sunni regions . Shia Muslims predominant in the green area of Yemen 's West , with the rest of Yemen being Sunni Muslims . Yemeni ethnic groups are predominantly Arabs , followed by Afro - Arabs , South Asians and Europeans . When the former states of North and South Yemen were established , most resident minority groups departed . Yemen is a largely tribal society . In the northern , mountainous parts of the country , there are 400 Zaidi tribes . There are also hereditary caste groups in urban areas such as Al - Akhdam . There are also Yemenis of Persian origin . According to Muqaddasi , Persians formed the majority of Aden 's population in the 10th century . Yemenite Jews once formed a sizable minority in Yemen with a distinct culture from other Jewish communities in the world . Most emigrated to Israel in the mid-20th century , following the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries and Operation Magic Carpet . An estimated 100,000 people of Indian origin are concentrated in the southern part of the country , around Aden , Mukalla , Shihr , Lahaj , Mokha and Hodeidah . Most of the prominent Indonesians , Malaysians , and Singaporeans of Arab descent are Hadhrami people with origins in southern Yemen in the Hadramawt coastal region . Today there are almost 10,000 Hadramis in Singapore . The Hadramis migrated to Southeast Asia , East Africa and the Indian subcontinent . The Maqil were a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes of Yemeni origin who migrated westwards via Egypt . Several groups of Yemeni Arabs turned south to Mauritania , and by the end of the 17th century , they dominated the entire country . They can also be found throughout Morocco and in Algeria as well as in other North African Countries . Yemen is the only country in the Arabian Peninsula that is signatory to two international accords dating back to 1951 and 1967 governing the protection of refugees . Yemen hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 124,600 in 2007 . Refugees and asylum seekers living in Yemen were predominantly from Somalia ( 110,600 ) , Iraq ( 11,000 ) , Ethiopia ( 2,000 ) , and Syria . Additionally , more than 334,000 Yemenis have been internally displaced by conflict . The Yemeni diaspora is largely concentrated in neighbouring Saudi Arabia , where between 800,000 and 1 million Yemenis reside , and the United Kingdom , home to between 70,000 and 80,000 Yemenis . Languages ( edit ) Modern Standard Arabic is the official language of Yemen . Yemeni Arabic . In al Mahrah Governorate in the far east and the island of Socotra , several non-Arabic languages are spoken . Yemeni Sign Language is used by the deaf community . Yemen is part of homeland of the South Semitic languages . Mehri is the largest South Semitic language spoken in the nation , with more than 70,000 speakers . The ethnic group itself is called Mahra . Soqotri is another South Semitic language , with speakers on the island of Socotra isolated from the pressures of Arabic on the Yemeni mainland . According to the 1990 census in Yemen , the number of speakers there was 57,000 . Yemen was also home of the Old South Arabian languages . The Razihi language appears to be the only remaining Old South Arabian language . English is the most important foreign language , being widely taught and spoken mostly in the south , a former British colony . There are a significant number of Russian speakers , originating from Yemeni - Russian cross-marriages occurring mainly in the 1970s and 1980s . A small Cham - speaking community is found in the capital city of Sana'a , originating from refugees expatriated from Vietnam after the Vietnam War in the 1970s .

Religion in Yemen consists primarily of two principal Islamic religious groups : About 56 % of the Muslim population is Sunni and 44 % is Shia , according to the International Religious Freedom Report . Sunnis are primarily Shafi'i but also include significant groups of Malikis and Hanbalis . Shias are primarily Zaidi and also have significant minorities of Ismaili and Twelver Shias . Meanwhile , it is said that Zaidi Shias of Yemen ( especially Al - houthis ) have near feeling in their beliefs and thoughts to Twelver Shia Muslims . The Sunnis are predominantly in the south and southeast . The Zaidis are predominantly in the north and northwest whilst the Ismailis are in the main centers such as Sana'a and Ma'rib . There are mixed communities in the larger cities . About . 5 percent of Yemenis are non-Muslim -- adhering to Christianity , Judaism , or Hinduism or having no religious affiliation . Estimates of the number of Christians in Yemen range from 25,000 to 41,000 . A 2015 study estimates 400 Christians from a Muslim background in the country . There are approximately 50 Jews left in Yemen . Some 200 Yemenite Jews were brought to Israel by the Jewish Agency circa 2016 . Culture ( edit ) Main article : Culture of Yemen The National Museum in Sana'a \u200c Typical Yemeni House Yemen is a culturally rich country with influence from many civilizations , such as the early civilization of Sheba . Media ( edit ) Main article : Media of Yemen Dance in Sa'dah , northwestern Yemen . Radio broadcasting in Yemen began in the 1940s when it was still divided into the South by the British and the North by the Imami ruling system . After the unification of Yemen in 1990 , the Yemeni government reformed its corporations and founded some additional radio stations that broadcast locally . However , it drew back after 1994 , due to destroyed infrastructure resulting from the civil war . Television is the most significant media platform in Yemen . Given the low literacy rate in the country , television is the main source of news for Yemenis . There are six free - to - air channels currently headquartered in Yemen , of which four are state - owned . The Yemeni film industry is in its early stages ; only two Yemeni films have been released as of 2008 . Theatre ( edit ) Main article : Theatre in Yemen The history of Yemeni theatre dates back at least a century , to the early 1900s . Both amateur and professional ( government - sponsored ) theatre troupes perform in the country 's major urban centers . Many of Yemen 's significant poets and authors , like Ali Ahmed Ba Kathir , Muhammad al - Sharafi , and Wajdi al - Ahdal , have written dramatic works ; poems , novels , and short stories by Yemeni authors like Mohammad Abdul - Wali and Abdulaziz Al - Maqaleh have also been adapted for the stage . There have been Yemeni productions of plays by Arab authors such as Tawfiq al - Hakim and Saadallah Wannous and by Western authors , including Shakespeare , Pirandello , Brecht , and Tennessee Williams . Historically speaking , the southern port city of Aden is the cradle of Yemeni theatre ; in recent decades the capital , Sana'a , has hosted numerous theatre festivals , often in conjunction with World Theatre Day . Sport ( edit ) Football is the most popular sport in Yemen . The Yemen Football Association is a member of FIFA and AFC . The Yemeni national football team participates internationally . The country also hosts many football clubs . They compete in the national and international leagues . Yemen 's mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports , such as biking , rock climbing , trekking , hiking , and other more challenging sports , including mountain climbing . Mountain climbing and hiking tours to the Sarawat Mountains and the Jabal an Nabi Shu'ayb , including the 3,000 m ( 9,800 ft ) peaks in the region , are seasonally organized by local and international alpine agencies . The coastal areas of Yemen and Socotra island also provide many opportunities for water sports , such as surfing , bodyboarding , sailing , swimming , and scuba diving . Socotra island is home to some of the best surfing destinations in the world . Camel jumping is a traditional sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe on the west coast of Yemen in a desert plain by the Red Sea . Camels are placed side to side and victory goes to the competitor who leaps , from a running start , over the most camels . The jumpers train year round for competitions . Tribesmen ( women may not compete ) tuck their robes around their waists for freedom of movement while running and leaping . Yemen 's biggest sports event was hosting the 2010 Gulf Cup of Nations in Aden and Abyan in the southern part of the country on 22 November 2010 . Many thought Yemen was the strongest competitor , but it was defeated in the first three matches of the tournament . Internationally , Naseem Hamed , a world champion boxer , is the most well known Yemeni athlete . World Heritage sites ( edit ) Main article : Tourism in Yemen High - rise architecture at Shibam , Wadi Hadramawt \u200c Among Yemen 's natural and cultural attractions are four World Heritage sites . The Old Walled City of Shibam in Wadi Hadhramaut , inscribed by UNESCO in 1982 , two years after Yemen joined the World Heritage Committee , is nicknamed `` Manhattan of the Desert '' because of its `` skyscrapers . '' Surrounded by a fortified wall made of mud and straw , the 16th - century city is one of the oldest examples of urban planning based on the principle of vertical construction . The ancient Old City of Sana'a , at an altitude of more than 2,100 metres ( 7,000 ft ) , has been inhabited for over two and a half millennia and was inscribed in 1986 . Sana'a became a major Islamic centre in the 7th century , and the 103 mosques , 14 hammams ( traditional bath houses ) , and more than 6,000 houses that survive all date from before the 11th century . Close to the Red Sea Coast , the Historic Town of Zabid , inscribed in 1993 , was Yemen 's capital from the 13th to the 15th century , and is an archaeological and historical site . It played an important role for many centuries because of its university , which was a center of learning for the whole Arab and Islamic world . Algebra is said to have been invented there in the early 9th century by the little - known scholar Al - Jazari . The latest addition to Yemen 's list of World Heritage Sites is the Socotra Archipelago . Mentioned by Marco Polo in the 13th century , this remote and isolated archipelago consists of four islands and two rocky islets delineating the southern limit of the Gulf of Aden . The site has a rich biodiversity . Nowhere else in the world do 37 % of Socotra 's 825 plants , 90 % of its reptiles and 95 % of its snails occur . It is home to 192 bird species , 253 species of coral , 730 species of coastal fish , and 300 species of crab and lobster , as well as a range of Aloes and the Dragon 's Blood Tree ( Dracaena cinnabari ) . The cultural heritage of Socotra includes the unique Soqotri language . Education ( edit ) Main article : Education in Yemen New Sana'a University in Sana . The adult literacy rate in 2010 was 64 % . The government has committed to reduce illiteracy to less than 10 % by 2025 . Although Yemen 's government provides for universal , compulsory , free education for children ages six through 15 , the U.S. Department of State reports that compulsory attendance is not enforced . The government developed the National Basic Education Development Strategy in 2003 that aimed at providing education to 95 % of Yemeni children between the ages of six and 14 years and also at decreasing the gap between males and females in urban and rural areas . Literacy Rate of Yemen population plus15 1995 -- 2015 by UNESCO Institute of Statistics A seven - year project to improve gender equity and the quality and efficiency of secondary education , focusing on girls in rural areas , was approved by the World Bank in March 2008 . Following this , Yemen has increased its education spending from 5 % of GDP in 1995 to 10 % in 2005 . According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities , the top - ranking universities in the country are the Yemeni University of Science & Technology ( 6532nd worldwide ) , Al Ahgaff University ( 8930th ) and Sanaa University ( 11043rd ) . Health ( edit ) Main article : Health in Yemen See also : Famine in Yemen and 2016 -- 17 Yemen cholera outbreak A Yemeni doctor examines an infant in a USAID - sponsored health care clinic . According to 2009 estimates , life expectancy in Yemen is 63.27 years . Despite the significant progress Yemen has made to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade , the system remains severely underdeveloped . Total expenditures on health care in 2004 constituted 5 % of gross domestic product . In that same year , the per capita expenditure for health care was very low compared with other Middle Eastern countries -- US $34 per capita according to the World Health Organization . The number of doctors in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7 % between 1995 and 2000 . as of 2005 there were three doctors per 10,000 people . In 2005 Yemen had 6.1 hospital beds available per 10,000 persons . Health care services are particularly scarce in rural areas . 25 % of rural areas are covered by health services , compared with 80 % of urban areas . Most childhood deaths are caused by illnesses for which vaccines exist or that are otherwise preventable . Circa 2009 Sana'a may be the first capital city in the world to run out of drinking water .

Click here to see the photograph in 360 degrees . Fynbos ( \/ \u02c8fe\u026anb\u0252s \/ ; Dutch pronunciation : ( \u02c8f\u025bi\u032fnbos ) meaning fine - leaved plants ) is a small belt of natural shrubland or heathland vegetation located on the Western Cape of South Africa . This area is predominantly winter rainfall coastal and mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate . The fynbos ecoregion is within the Mediterranean forests , woodlands , and scrub biome . In fields related to biogeography , fynbos is known for its exceptional degree of biodiversity and endemism , consisting about 80 % ( 8,500 fynbos ) species of the Cape floral kingdom where nearly 6,000 of them are endemic . This land has faced severe threats and still does , but due to the many economic uses conservation efforts are being made to help restore it . Contents ( hide ) 1 Overview and history 2 Cape Floral Kingdom 3 Flora 4 Ecoregions 5 Economic uses 6 Threats and conservation 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Overview and history ( edit ) The word fynbos is often confusingly said to mean `` fine bush '' in Afrikaans , as `` bos '' means `` bush '' . Typical fynbos foliage is ericoid rather than fine . The term , in its pre-Afrikaans , Dutch form , fynbosch , was recorded by Noble as being in casual use in the late 19th century . In the early 20th century , John Bews referred to : `` South - Western or Cape Region of Macchia or Fynbosch '' . He said : `` In this well - known region where the rain occurs in winter and the summers are more or less dry , the dominant vegetation is of a sclerophyllous type and there is little or no natural grassland , though there are many grasses ... '' He also refers to a high degree of endemism in the grasses in that region . Elsewhere he speaks of the term as `` ... applied by the inhabitants of the Cape to any sort of small woodland growth that does not include timber trees '' ; in the current vernacular , this still is the effective sense of the word . However , in the technical , ecological sense , the constraints are more demanding . In the latter half of the 20th century , `` fynbos '' gained currency as the term for the `` distinctive vegetation of the southwestern Cape '' . Cape floral kingdom ( edit ) The Cape Floral Kingdom ( Capensis ) is one of only 6 floristic kingdoms in the world . It is also the smallest and richest per unit of area . Main article : Cape Floristic Region Fynbos -- which grows in a 100 - to - 200 - km - wide coastal belt stretching from Clanwilliam on the West coast to Port Elizabeth on the Southeast coast -- forms part of the Cape floral kingdom , where it accounts for half of the surface area and 80 % of the plant species . The fynbos in the western regions is richer and more varied than in the eastern regions of South Africa . Of the world 's six floral kingdoms , this is the smallest and richest per unit of area . The Holarctic kingdom , in contrast , incorporates the whole of the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics . The diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high , with over 9000 species of plants occurring in the area , around 6200 of which are endemic , i.e. growing nowhere else in the world . South Africa 's Western Cape has a level of botanic diversity that exceeds that of the richest tropical rainforest in South America , including the Amazon . Of the Ericas , over 600 occur in the fynbos kingdom , while only two or three dozen have been described in the rest of the world . This is in an area of 46,000 km -- by comparison , the Netherlands , with an area of 33,000 km , has 1400 species , none of them endemic . Table Mountain in Cape Town supports 2200 species , more than the entire United Kingdom . Thus , although the fynbos covers only 6 % of the area of southern Africa , it has half the species on the subcontinent -- and in fact has almost 1 in 5 of all African plant species so far described . Five main river systems traverse the Cape floral kingdom : the Oliphants River of the Western Cape ; the Berg River which drains the West Coast Forelands plain stretching from the Cape Flats to the Olifants ; the Breede , which is the largest river on the Cape ; the Olifants River ( Southern Cape ) ; Gourits and the Groot Rivers which drain the Little Karoo basin and the South Coast Forelands ; and the Baviaanskloof and Gamtoos Rivers to the east . Flora ( edit ) Peninsula Shale Fynbos flora on Devils Peak , Cape Town . Gladiolus alatus flowers in Cape fynbos . The most conspicuous components of the flora are evergreen sclerophyllous plants , many with ericoid leaves and gracile habit , as opposed to timber forest . Several plant families are conspicuous in fynbos ; the Proteaceae are prominent , with genera such as Protea , Leucospermum ( the `` pincushions '' ) , and Leucadendron ( the silver tree and `` cone bushes '' ) . Proteas are represented by many species and are prominent in the landscape , generally with large striking flowers , many of which are pollinated by birds , and others by small mammals . Most of these do not have anything like ericoid leaves , and nor do most Rhamnaceae , Fabaceae , or Geraniaceae . Fynbos Ericaceae include more species of Erica than all other regions combined . They are popularly called heaths and are generally smaller plants bearing many small , tubular or globular flowers and ericoid leaves . Restionaceae also occur in greater variety in fynbos than anywhere else ; their species are superficially grass - like . Many of them grow in wet areas such as seasonal marshes and spongy basins in the sources of mountain streams , but others grow in decidedly arid conditions . Depending on the locality and the aspects under discussion , several other families have equal claim to being characteristic , including Asteraceae , Rutaceae , and Iridaceae . More than 1400 bulb species occur among the fynbos , of which 96 are Gladiolus and 54 Lachenalia . Areas that are dominated by `` renosterbos '' , Elytropappus rhinocerotis , ( Asteraceae ) are known as Renosterveld ( Afrikaans for `` rhinoceros veld '' ) . Ecoregions ( edit ) The fynbos area has been divided into two very similar ecoregions : the lowland fynbos ( below 300 m above sea level ) on the sandy soil of the west coast , and the montane fynbos of the Cape Fold Belt . Lowland fynbos , in this case Hangklip Sand Fynbos on the Cape Peninsula Montane fynbos , in this case Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos on the Cape Peninsula Renosterveld , in this case Swartland Shale Renosterveld The Lowland Fynbos and Renosterveld experiences regular winter rainfall , especially to the west of Cape Agulhas . The ecoregion has been subdivided into 9 areas : the West Coast Forelands from the Cape Flats to the Olifants River ( Western Cape ) ; the Warm Bokkeveld basin around the town of Ceres ; the Elgin Valley around the town of Elgin ; the sandy Agulhas Plain on the coast ; the Breede River valley around the town of Worcester ; the South Coast Forelands from Caledon west to Mossel Bay ; the south - eastern end of the Little Karoo ; Langkloof valley ; and the Southeastern Coast Forelands west from Tsitsikamma to Port Elizabeth . The flora of the lowlands contains a high number of endemic species , and tends to favour larger plants than those growing on the hillier areas . They include the larger Restionaceae such as species of Elegia , Thamnochortus , and Willdenowia and proteas such as king protea ( Protea cynaroides ) and blushing bride ( Serruria florida ) . Particular types of lowland fynbos include the shrubs and herbs of the coastal sand dunes , the mixture of ericoids and restoids with thickets of shrubs such as Maytenus , and other Celastraceae , sideroxylons and other Sapotaceae , and Rhus and other Anacardiaceae on the coastal sands ; the classic fynbos of the sandplains of the West Coast Forelands , and the Agulhas Plain ; the grassy fynbos of the hillier and wetter areas of the South and South - Eastern Coast Forelands ; areas where fynbos and renosterveld are mixed ; coastal renosterveld on the West and South Coast Forelands ; and the inland renosterveld of the drier inland Little Karoo and Warm Bokkeveld . The area is also home to a large number of endemic creatures that have adapted to life in this area , such as the monkey beetles which pollinate Ixia viridiflora . Endemic species of fish in the five river systems occur in the area , too . Endemic reptiles and amphibians include a number of tortoises and the chameleon - like arum frog ( Hyperolius horstockii ) . The Montane Fynbos and Renosterveld is the area above 300 m , a total of 45,000 km of the Cape Fold Mountains . The same level of floral variety , including all three characteristic fynbos families , is found there , but ericas predominate . Because the higher and wetter areas are more protected and contain important water sources , the original flora is more intact than in the lowlands ; but agriculture and global warming are stll threats . The region includes the mountains in the west from the Cape Peninsula to the Kouebokkeveld Mountains , the south coast hinterland from Elgin to Port Elizabeth , the mountains north of the Little Karoo from Laingsburg to Willowmore , and the inselberg hills within the Little Karoo . About half of these areas are originally fynbos , and about half are renosterveld . Many different microclimates occur , so the flora changes from west to east , and also varies with altitude up the hillsides away from the coast and according to compass direction . Lower elevations are covered with protea fynbos , with ericas taking over further up . Plant species include pincushions ( Leucospermum ) . The wildlife includes a number of endemic bees , beetles , horseflies , and ants , and birds such as Cape sugarbirds and the orange - breasted sunbird . Many of these birds and insects are important and specific pollinators for the fynbos , such as the mountain pride butterfly ( Aeropetes tulbaghia ) which only visits red flowers such as Disa uniflora and pollinates 15 different species . Larger animals include antelopes , particularly Cape grysbok ( Raphicerus melanotis ) , common duiker ( Sylvicapra grimmia ) , and klipspringer ( Oreotragus oreotragus ) . The extinct blue antelope and quagga were also fynbos natives . Economic uses ( edit ) Rooibos ( Aspalathus linearis ) and honeybush ( Cyclopia intermedia ) are of economic importance , grown and harvested in large quantities in the Cederberg area , and providing important exports . Restios continue to be used for thatching , as they have for hundreds or even thousands of years . Proteas and other floral species are grown in many areas and their flowers harvested for export . In many areas with Mediterranean climates , fynbos species have become popular garden plants , in particular aloes and geraniums , and in cooler regions are used as window plants . A very large number of fynbos plant species are used in traditional medicine , and while only a tiny proportion have as yet been subjected to formal testing , many have already been identified as having medicinal properties . Threats and conservation ( edit ) The regrowth of fynbos species , from around the trunk of a fallen invasive pine tree . Cape Town . The fynbos is the region of South Africa most affected by invasive alien species which collectively cover around 10 % of the entire country . The most common invasive plants are wattles and hakeas , native to Australia , and pines native to Europe and the Californian coast of the United States . Pines had been introduced to South Africa by the 19th century and the wattles were imported into the mid-1870s to stabilize sand dunes . In 1997 it was estimated that invasion caused the fynbos region to decline in value by US $750 million per year . The Working for Water ( WfW ) program was started in 1995 by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to control these invasive species which were shown to sequester 9.95 % of usable surface water runoff . Since then , over 1,000 , 00 hectares of land have been cleared of invasive species while providing jobs to around 20,000 people per year , most of which are women and unskilled workers . Systematic monitoring of WfW 's progress is lacking but there is anecdotal evidence that endemic silver peas have returned to Table Mountain after being thought extinct .

Deaths Cherokee ( 4,000 ) Creek Seminole ( 3,000 in Second Seminole War -- 1835 -- 1842 ) Chickasaw ( 3,500 ) Choctaw ( 2,500 -- 6,000 ) The Trail of Tears was a series of forced relocations of Native American peoples from their ancestral homelands in the Southeastern United States , to areas to the west ( usually west of the Mississippi River ) that had been designated as Indian Territory . The forced relocations were carried out by government authorities following the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830 . The relocated peoples suffered from exposure , disease , and starvation while en route to their new designated reserve , and many died before reaching their destinations . The forced removals included members of the Cherokee , Muscogee ( Creek ) , Seminole , Chickasaw , Choctaw , and Ponca nations . The phrase `` Trail of Tears '' originates from a description of the removal of many Native American tribes , including the infamous Cherokee Nation relocation in 1838 . Between 1830 and 1850 , the Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek , Seminole , and Cherokee people ( including mixed - race and black slaves who lived among them ) were forcibly removed from their traditional lands in the Southeastern United States , and relocated farther west . Those Native Americans who were relocated were forced to march to their destinations by state and local militias . The Cherokee removal in 1838 ( the last forced removal east of the Mississippi ) was brought on by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega , Georgia in 1828 , resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush . Approximately 2,000 -- 8,000 of the 16,543 relocated Cherokee perished along the way .

Oklahoma is depicted in light yellow - green . In 1830 , a group of Indians collectively referred to as the Five Civilized Tribes ( the Cherokee , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Muscogee , and Seminole tribes ) were living as autonomous nations in what would be later called the American Deep South . The process of cultural transformation , as proposed by George Washington and Henry Knox , was gaining momentum , especially among the Cherokee and Choctaw . American settlers had been pressuring the federal government to remove Indians from the Southeast ; many settlers were encroaching on Indian lands , while others wanted more land made available to white settlers . Although the effort was vehemently opposed by some , including U.S. Congressman Davy Crockett of Tennessee , President Andrew Jackson was able to gain Congressional passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , which authorized the government to extinguish Indian title to lands in the Southeast . In 1831 , the Choctaw became the first Nation to be removed , and their removal served as the model for all future relocations . After two wars , many Seminoles were removed in 1832 . The Creek removal followed in 1834 , the Chickasaw in 1837 , and lastly the Cherokee in 1838 . However , some managed to evade the removals and remained in their ancestral homelands ; some Choctaw are living in Mississippi , Creek in Alabama and Florida , Cherokee in North Carolina , and Seminole in Florida ; a small group had escaped into the Everglades and were never defeated by the United States government . A small number of non-Native Americans who lived with the tribes , including some of African descent ( some as slaves , and others as spouses or freedmen ) , also accompanied the Indians on the trek westward . By 1837 , 46,000 Indians from the southeastern states had been removed from their homelands , thereby opening 25 million acres ( 100,000 km ) for predominantly white settlement . Prior to 1838 , the fixed boundaries of these autonomous tribal nations , comprising large areas of the United States , were subject to continual cession and annexation , in part due to pressure from squatters and the threat of military force in the newly declared U.S. territories -- federally administered regions whose boundaries supervened upon the Native treaty claims . As these territories became U.S. states , state governments sought to dissolve the boundaries of the Indian nations within their borders , which were independent of state jurisdiction , and to expropriate the land therein . These pressures were exacerbated by U.S. population growth and the expansion of slavery in the South , with the rapid development of cotton cultivation in the uplands following the invention of the cotton gin . Jackson 's role ( edit ) Andrew Jackson 's support for removal of Native Americans began at least a decade before his presidency . Indian removal was Jackson 's top legislative priority upon taking office . The removals , conducted under both Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren , followed the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , which provided the President with powers to exchange land with Native tribes and provide infrastructure improvements on the existing lands . The law also gave the president power to pay for transportation costs to the West , should tribes choose to relocate . The law did not , however , allow the President to force tribes to move West without a mutually agreed - upon treaty . Referring to the Indian Removal Act , Martin Van Buren , Jackson 's vice president and successor is quoted as saying `` There was no measure , in the whole course of ( Jackson 's ) administration , of which he was more exclusively the author than this . '' In the years following the Act , the Cherokee filed several lawsuits regarding conflicts with the state of Georgia . Some of these cases reached the Supreme Court , the most influential being Worcester v. Georgia ( 1832 ) . Samuel Worcester and other non-Indians were convicted by Georgia law for residing in Cherokee territory in the state of Georgia without a license . Worcester was sentenced to prison for four years and appealed the ruling , arguing that this sentence violated treaties made between Indian nations and the United States federal government by imposing state laws on Cherokee lands . The Court ruled in Worcester 's favor , declaring that the Cherokee Nation was subject only to federal law and that the Supremacy Clause barred legislative interference by the state of Georgia . Chief Justice Marshall argued , `` The Cherokee nation , then , is a distinct community occupying its own territory in which the laws of Georgia can have no force . The whole intercourse between the United States and this Nation , is , by our constitution and laws , vested in the government of the United States . '' Andrew Jackson did not listen to the Supreme Court mandate barring Georgia from intruding on Cherokee lands . He feared that enforcement would lead to open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia , which would compound the ongoing crisis in South Carolina and lead to a broader civil war . Instead , he vigorously negotiated a land exchange treaty with the Cherokee . Political opponents Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams , who supported the Worcester decision , were outraged by Jackson 's refusal to uphold Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia . Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote an account of Cherokee assimilation into the American culture , declaring his support of the Worcester decision . Jackson chose to continue with Indian removal , and negotiated The Treaty of New Echota , on December 29 , 1835 , which granted Cherokee Indians two years to move to Indian Territory ( modern Oklahoma ) . Only a fraction of the Cherokees left voluntarily . The U.S. government , with assistance from state militias , forced most of the remaining Cherokees west in 1838 . The Cherokees were temporarily remanded in camps in eastern Tennessee . In November , the Cherokee were broken into groups of around 1,000 each and began the journey west . They endured heavy rains , snow , and freezing temperatures . When the Cherokee negotiated the Treaty of New Echota , they exchanged all their land east of the Mississippi for land in modern Oklahoma and a $5 million payment from the federal government . Many Cherokee felt betrayed that their leadership accepted the deal , and over 16,000 Cherokee signed a petition to prevent the passage of the treaty . By the end of the decade in 1840 , tens of thousands of Cherokee and other tribes had been removed from their land east of the Mississippi River . The Creek , Choctaw , Seminole , and Chicksaw were also relocated under the Indian Removal Act of 1830 . One Choctaw leader portrayed the removal as `` A Trail of Tears and Deaths '' , a devastating event that removed most of the Native population of the southeastern United States from their traditional homelands . Terminology ( edit ) The latter forced relocations have sometimes been referred to as `` death marches '' , in particular with reference to the Cherokee march across the Midwest in 1838 , which occurred on a predominantly land route . Indians who had the means initially provided for their own removal . Contingents that were led by conductors from the U.S. Army included those led by Edward Deas , who was claimed to be a sympathizer for the Cherokee plight . The largest death toll from the Cherokee forced relocation comes from the period after the May 23 , 1838 deadline . This was at the point when the remaining Cherokee were rounded into camps and pressed into oversized detachments , often over 700 in size ( larger than the populations of Little Rock or Memphis at that time ) . Communicable diseases spread quickly through these closely quartered groups , killing many . These contingents were among the last to move , but following the same routes the others had taken ; the areas they were going through had been depleted of supplies due to the vast numbers that had gone before them . The marchers were subject to extortion and violence along the route . In addition , these final contingents were forced to set out during the hottest and coldest months of the year , killing many . Exposure to the elements , disease and starvation , harassment by local frontiersmen , and insufficient rations similarly killed up to one - third of the Choctaw and other nations on the march . There exists some debate among historians and the affected tribes as to whether the term `` Trail of Tears '' should be used to refer to the entire history of forced relocations from the United States east of the Mississippi into Indian Territory ( as was the stated U.S. policy ) , or to the Five Tribes described above , to the route of the land march specifically , or to specific marches in which the remaining holdouts from each area were rounded up . Legal background ( edit ) This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( January 2014 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The territorial boundaries claimed as sovereign and controlled by the Indian nations living in what were then known as the Indian Territories -- the portion of the early United States west of the Mississippi River not yet claimed or allotted to become Oklahoma -- were fixed and determined by national treaties with the United States federal government . These recognized the tribal governments as dependent but internally sovereign , or autonomous nations under the sole jurisdiction of the federal government . While retaining their tribal governance , which included a constitution or official council in tribes such as the Iroquois and Cherokee , many portions of the southeastern Indian nations had become partially or completely economically integrated into the economy of the region . This included the plantation economy in states such as Georgia , and the possession of slaves . These slaves were also forcibly relocated during the process of removal . A similar process had occurred earlier in the territories controlled by the Confederacy of the Six Nations in what is now upstate New York prior to the British invasion and subsequent U.S. annexation of the Iroquois nation . Under the history of U.S. treaty law , the territorial boundaries claimed by federally recognized tribes received the same status under which the Southeastern tribal claims were recognized ; until the following establishment of reservations of land , determined by the federal government , which were ceded to the remaining tribes by de jure treaty , in a process that often entailed forced relocation . The establishment of the Indian Territory and the extinguishment of Indian land claims east of the Mississippi anticipated the establishment of the U.S. Indian reservation system . It was imposed on remaining Indian lands later in the 19th century . The statutory argument for Indian sovereignty persisted until the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia ( 1831 ) , that ( e.g. ) the Cherokee were not a sovereign and independent nation , and therefore not entitled to a hearing before the court . However , in Worcester v. Georgia ( 1832 ) , the court re-established limited internal sovereignty under the sole jurisdiction of the federal government , in a ruling that both opposed the subsequent forced relocation and set the basis for modern U.S. case law . While the latter ruling was defied by Jackson , the actions of the Jackson administration were not isolated because state and federal officials had violated treaties without consequence , often attributed to military exigency , as the members of individual Indian nations were not automatically United States citizens and were rarely given standing in any U.S. court . Jackson 's involvement in what became known as the Trail of Tears can not be ignored . In a speech regarding Indian removal , Jackson said , `` It will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites ; free them from the power of the States ; enable them to pursue happiness in their own way and under their own rude institutions ; will retard the progress of decay , which is lessening their numbers , and perhaps cause them gradually , under the protection of the Government and through the influence of good counsels , to cast off their savage habits and become an interesting , civilized , and Christian community . '' According to Jackson , the move would be nothing but beneficial for all parties . His point of view garnered support from many Americans , many of whom would benefit economically from the removal . This was compounded by the fact that while citizenship tests existed for Indians living in newly annexed areas before and after forced relocation , individual U.S. states did not recognize tribal land claims , only individual title under State law , and distinguished between the rights of white and non-white citizens , who often had limited standing in court ; and Indian removal was carried out under U.S. military jurisdiction , often by state militias . As a result , individual Indians who could prove U.S. citizenship were nevertheless displaced from newly annexed areas . The military actions and subsequent treaties enacted by Jackson 's and Martin Van Buren 's administrations pursuant to the 1830 law , which Tennessee Congressman Davy Crockett had unsuccessfully voted against , are widely considered to have directly caused the expulsion or death of a substantial part of the Indian population then living in the southeastern United States . Choctaw Removal ( edit ) Main article : Choctaw Trail of Tears George W. Harkins , Choctaw chief The Choctaw nation occupied large portions of what are now the U.S. states of Alabama , Mississippi , and Louisiana . After a series of treaties starting in 1801 , the Choctaw nation was reduced to 11,000,000 acres ( 45,000 km ) . The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek ceded the remaining country to the United States and was ratified in early 1831 . The removals were only agreed to after a provision in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek allowed some Choctaw to remain . The chief of the Choctaw tribe , George W. Harkins , wrote to the citizens of the United States before the removals were to commence : It is with considerable diffidence that I attempt to address the American people , knowing and feeling sensibly my incompetency ; and believing that your highly and well improved minds would not be well entertained by the address of a Choctaw . But having determined to emigrate west of the Mississippi river this fall , I have thought proper in bidding you farewell to make a few remarks expressive of my views , and the feelings that actuate me on the subject of our removal ... We as Choctaws rather chose to suffer and be free , than live under the degrading influence of laws , which our voice could not be heard in their formation . -- George W. Harkins , George W. Harkins to the American People United States Secretary of War Lewis Cass appointed George Gaines to manage the removals . Gaines decided to remove Choctaws in three phases starting in 1831 and ending in 1833 . The first was to begin on November 1 , 1831 with groups meeting at Memphis and Vicksburg . A harsh winter would batter the emigrants with flash floods , sleet , and snow . Initially the Choctaws were to be transported by wagon but floods halted them . With food running out , the residents of Vicksburg and Memphis were concerned . Five steamboats ( the Walter Scott , the Brandywine , the Reindeer , the Talma , and the Cleopatra ) would ferry Choctaws to their river - based destinations . The Memphis group traveled up the Arkansas for about 60 miles ( 100 km ) to Arkansas Post . There the temperature stayed below freezing for almost a week with the rivers clogged with ice , so there could be no travel for weeks . Food rationing consisted of a handful of boiled corn , one turnip , and two cups of heated water per day . Forty government wagons were sent to Arkansas Post to transport them to Little Rock . When they reached Little Rock , a Choctaw chief referred to their trek as a `` trail of tears and death '' . The Vicksburg group was led by an incompetent guide and was lost in the Lake Providence swamps . Alexis de Tocqueville , French political thinker and historian Alexis de Tocqueville , the French philosopher , witnessed the Choctaw removals while in Memphis , Tennessee in 1831 : In the whole scene there was an air of ruin and destruction , something which betrayed a final and irrevocable adieu ; one could n't watch without feeling one 's heart wrung . The Indians were tranquil , but sombre and taciturn . There was one who could speak English and of whom I asked why the Chactas were leaving their country . `` To be free , '' he answered , could never get any other reason out of him . We ... watch the expulsion ... of one of the most celebrated and ancient American peoples . -- Alexis de Tocqueville , Democracy in America Nearly 17,000 Choctaws made the move to what would be called Indian Territory and then later Oklahoma . About 2,500 -- 6,000 died along the trail of tears . Approximately 5,000 -- 6,000 Choctaws remained in Mississippi in 1831 after the initial removal efforts . The Choctaws who chose to remain in newly formed Mississippi were subject to legal conflict , harassment , and intimidation . The Choctaws `` have had our habitations torn down and burned , our fences destroyed , cattle turned into our fields and we ourselves have been scourged , manacled , fettered and otherwise personally abused , until by such treatment some of our best men have died '' . The Choctaws in Mississippi were later reformed as the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the removed Choctaws became the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma . The Choctaws were the first to sign a removal treaty presented by the federal government . President Andrew Jackson wanted strong negotiations with the Choctaws in Mississippi , and the Choctaws seemed much more cooperative than Andrew Jackson had imagined . When commissioners and Choctaws came to negotiation agreements it was said the United States would bear the expense of moving their homes and that they had to be removed within two and a half years of the signed treaty . Seminole resistance ( edit ) Main article : Seminole Wars The U.S. acquired Florida from Spain via the Adams -- On\u00eds Treaty and took possession in 1821 . In 1832 the Seminoles were called to a meeting at Payne 's Landing on the Ocklawaha River . The treaty negotiated called for the Seminoles to move west , if the land were found to be suitable . They were to be settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe , who considered them deserters ; some of the Seminoles had been derived from Creek bands but also from other tribes . Those among the tribe who once were members of Creek bands did not wish to move west to where they were certain that they would meet death for leaving the main band of Creek Indians . The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832 . After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already settled there , the seven chiefs signed a statement on March 28 , 1833 that the new land was acceptable . Upon their return to Florida , however , most of the chiefs renounced the statement , claiming that they had not signed it , or that they had been forced to sign it , and in any case , that they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation . The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded , however , and went west in 1834 . On December 28 , 1835 a group of Seminoles and blacks ambushed a U.S. Army company marching from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King in Ocala , killing all but three of the 110 army troops . This came to be known as the Dade Massacre . Seminole warrior Tuko - see - mathla , 1834 As the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in , Florida began preparing for war . The St. Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of 500 muskets . Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K. Call . Indian war parties raided farms and settlements , and families fled to forts , large towns , or out of the territory altogether . A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train , killing eight of its guards and wounding six others . Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later . Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine were destroyed , with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles . Other warchiefs such as Halleck Tustenuggee , Jumper , and Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse continued the Seminole resistance against the army . The war ended , after a full decade of fighting , in 1842 . The U.S. government is estimated to have spent about $20,000,000 on the war , at the time an astronomical sum , and equal to $507,172,414 today . Many Indians were forcibly exiled to Creek lands west of the Mississippi ; others retreated into the Everglades . In the end , the government gave up trying to subjugate the Seminole in their Everglades redoubts and left fewer than 500 Seminoles in peace . However , other scholars state that at least several hundred Seminoles remained in the Everglades after the Seminole Wars . As a result of the Seminole Wars , the surviving Seminole band of the Everglades claims to be the only federally recognized tribe which never relinquished sovereignty or signed a peace treaty with the United States . In general the American people tended to view the Indian resistance as unwarranted . An article published by the Virginia Enquirer on January 26 , 1836 , called the `` Hostilities of the Seminoles '' , assigned all the blame for the violence that came from the Seminole 's resistance to the Seminoles themselves . The article accuses the Indians of not staying true to their word -- the promises they supposedly made in the treaties and negotiations from the Indian Removal Act . Creek dissolution ( edit ) Main article : Muscogee Selocta ( or Shelocta ) was a Muscogee chief who appealed to Andrew Jackson to reduce the demands for Creek lands at the signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson After the War of 1812 , some Muscogee leaders such as William McIntosh signed treaties that ceded more land to Georgia . The 1814 signing of the Treaty of Fort Jackson signaled the end for the Creek Nation and for all Indians in the South . Friendly Creek leaders , like Selocta and Big Warrior , addressed Sharp Knife ( the Indian nickname for Andrew Jackson ) and reminded him that they keep the peace . Nevertheless , Jackson retorted that they did not `` cut ( Tecumseh 's ) throat '' when they had the chance , so they must now cede Creek lands . Jackson also ignored Article 9 of the Treaty of Ghent that restored sovereignty to Indians and their nations . Jackson opened this first peace session by faintly acknowledging the help of the friendly Creeks . That done , he turned to the Red Sticks and admonished them for listening to evil counsel . For their crime , he said , the entire Creek Nation must pay . He demanded the equivalent of all expenses incurred by the United States in prosecuting the war , which by his calculation came to 23,000,000 acres ( 93,000 km ) of land . -- Robert V. Remini , Andrew Jackson Eventually , the Creek Confederacy enacted a law that made further land cessions a capital offense . Nevertheless , on February 12 , 1825 , McIntosh and other chiefs signed the Treaty of Indian Springs , which gave up most of the remaining Creek lands in Georgia . After the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty , McIntosh was assassinated on May 13 , 1825 , by Creeks led by Menawa . The Creek National Council , led by Opothle Yohola , protested to the United States that the Treaty of Indian Springs was fraudulent . President John Quincy Adams was sympathetic , and eventually the treaty was nullified in a new agreement , the Treaty of Washington ( 1826 ) . The historian R. Douglas Hurt wrote : `` The Creeks had accomplished what no Indian nation had ever done or would do again -- achieve the annulment of a ratified treaty . '' However , Governor Troup of Georgia ignored the new treaty and began to forcibly remove the Indians under the terms of the earlier treaty . At first , President Adams attempted to intervene with federal troops , but Troup called out the militia , and Adams , fearful of a civil war , conceded . As he explained to his intimates , `` The Indians are not worth going to war over . '' Although the Creeks had been forced from Georgia , with many Lower Creeks moving to the Indian Territory , there were still about 20,000 Upper Creeks living in Alabama . However , the state moved to abolish tribal governments and extend state laws over the Creeks . Opothle Yohola appealed to the administration of President Andrew Jackson for protection from Alabama ; when none was forthcoming , the Treaty of Cusseta was signed on March 24 , 1832 , which divided up Creek lands into individual allotments . Creeks could either sell their allotments and receive funds to remove to the west , or stay in Alabama and submit to state laws . The Creeks were never given a fair chance to comply with the terms of the treaty , however . Rampant illegal settlement of their lands by Americans continued unabated with federal and state authorities unable or unwilling to do much to halt it . Further , as recently detailed by historian Billy Winn in his thorough chronicle of the events leading to removal , a variety of fraudulent schemes designed to cheat the Creeks out of their allotments , many of them organized by speculators operating out of Columbus , Georgia and Montgomery , Alabama , were perpetrated after the signing of the Treaty of Cusseta . A portion of the beleaguered Creeks , many desperately poor and feeling abused and oppressed by their American neighbors , struck back by carrying out occasional raids on area farms and committing other isolated acts of violence . Escalating tensions erupted into open war with the United States following the destruction of the village of Roanoke , Georgia , located along the Chattahoochee River on the boundary between Creek and American territory , in May 1836 . During the so - called `` Creek War of 1836 '' Secretary of War Lewis Cass dispatched General Winfield Scott to end the violence by forcibly removing the Creeks to the Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River . With the Indian Removal Act of 1830 it continued into 1835 and after as in 1836 over 15,000 Creeks were driven from their land for the last time . 3,500 of those 15,000 Creeks did not survive the trip to Oklahoma where they eventually settled . Chickasaw monetary Removal ( edit ) See also : Chickasaw Historic Marker in Marion , Arkansas , for the Trail of Tears Play media Fragment of the Trail of Tears still intact at Village Creek State Park , Arkansas ( 2010 ) The Chickasaw received financial compensation from the United States for their lands east of the Mississippi River . In 1836 , the Chickasaws had reached an agreement to purchase land from the previously removed Choctaws after a bitter five - year debate . They paid the Choctaws $530,000 ( equal to $11,810,970 today ) for the westernmost part of the Choctaw land . The first group of Chickasaws moved in 1836 and was led by John M. Millard . The Chickasaws gathered at Memphis on July 4 , 1836 , with all of their assets -- belongings , livestock , and slaves . Once across the Mississippi River , they followed routes previously established by the Choctaws and the Creeks . Once in Indian Territory , the Chickasaws merged with the Choctaw nation . Cherokee forced relocation ( edit ) Main article : Cherokee removal Cherokee Principal Chief John Ross , photographed before his death in 1866 By 1838 , about 2,000 Cherokee had voluntarily relocated from Georgia to Indian Territory ( present day Oklahoma ) . Forcible removals began in May 1838 when General Winfield Scott received a final order from President Martin Van Buren to relocate the remaining Cherokees . Approximately 4,000 Cherokees died in the ensuing trek to Oklahoma . In the Cherokee language , the event is called nu na da ul tsun yi ( `` the place where they cried '' ) or nu na hi du na tlo hi lu i ( the trail where they cried ) . The Cherokee Trail of Tears resulted from the enforcement of the Treaty of New Echota , an agreement signed under the provisions of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , which exchanged Indian land in the East for lands west of the Mississippi River , but which was never accepted by the elected tribal leadership or a majority of the Cherokee people . The sparsely inhabited Cherokee lands were highly attractive to Georgian farmers experiencing population pressure , and illegal settlements resulted . Long - simmering tensions between Georgia and the Cherokee Nation were brought to a crisis by the discovery of gold near Dahlonega , Georgia , in 1829 , resulting in the Georgia Gold Rush , the second gold rush in U.S. history . Hopeful gold speculators began trespassing on Cherokee lands , and pressure mounted to fulfill the Compact of 1802 in which the US Government promised to extinguish Indian land claims in the state of Georgia . When Georgia moved to extend state laws over Cherokee lands in 1830 , the matter went to the U.S. Supreme Court . In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia ( 1831 ) , the Marshall court ruled that the Cherokee Nation was not a sovereign and independent nation , and therefore refused to hear the case . However , in Worcester v. Georgia ( 1832 ) , the Court ruled that Georgia could not impose laws in Cherokee territory , since only the national government -- not state governments -- had authority in Indian affairs . Worcester v Georgia is associated with Andrew Jackson 's famous , though apocryphal , quote `` John Marshall has made his decision ; now let him enforce it ! '' In reality , this quote did not appear until 30 years after the incident and was first printed in a textbook authored by Jackson critic Horace Greeley . Elizabeth `` Betsy '' Brown Stephens ( 1903 ) , a Cherokee Indian who walked the Trail of Tears in 1838 Fearing open warfare between federal troops and the Georgia militia , Jackson decided not to enforce Cherokee claims against the state of Georgia . He was already embroiled in a constitutional crisis with South Carolina ( i.e. the nullification crisis ) and favored Cherokee relocation over civil war . With the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , the U.S. Congress had given Jackson authority to negotiate removal treaties , exchanging Indian land in the East for land west of the Mississippi River . Jackson used the dispute with Georgia to put pressure on the Cherokees to sign a removal treaty . The final treaty , passed in Congress by a single vote , and signed by President Andrew Jackson , was imposed by his successor President Martin Van Buren. Van Buren allowed Georgia , Tennessee , North Carolina , and Alabama an armed force of 7,000 militiamen , army regulars , and volunteers under General Winfield Scott to relocate about 13,000 Cherokees to Cleveland , Tennessee . After the initial roundup , the U.S. military oversaw the emigration to Oklahoma . Former Cherokee lands were immediately opened to settlement . Most of the deaths during the journey were caused by disease , malnutrition , and exposure during an unusually cold winter . In the winter of 1838 the Cherokee began the 1,000 - mile ( 1,600 km ) march with scant clothing and most on foot without shoes or moccasins . The march began in Red Clay , Tennessee , the location of the last Eastern capital of the Cherokee Nation . Because of the diseases , the Indians were not allowed to go into any towns or villages along the way ; many times this meant traveling much farther to go around them . After crossing Tennessee and Kentucky , they arrived at the Ohio River across from Golconda in southern Illinois about the 3rd of December 1838 . Here the starving Indians were charged a dollar a head ( equal to $22.98 today ) to cross the river on `` Berry 's Ferry '' which typically charged twelve cents , equal to $2.76 today . They were not allowed passage until the ferry had serviced all others wishing to cross and were forced to take shelter under `` Mantle Rock '' , a shelter bluff on the Kentucky side , until `` Berry had nothing better to do '' . Many died huddled together at Mantle Rock waiting to cross . Several Cherokee were murdered by locals . The Cherokee filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government through the courthouse in Vienna , suing the government for $35 a head ( equal to $804.34 today ) to bury the murdered Cherokee . As they crossed southern Illinois , on December 26 , Martin Davis , Commissary Agent for Moses Daniel 's detachment , wrote : `` There is the coldest weather in Illinois I ever experienced anywhere . The streams are all frozen over something like 8 or 12 inches ( 20 or 30 cm ) thick . We are compelled to cut through the ice to get water for ourselves and animals . It snows here every two or three days at the fartherest . We are now camped in Mississippi ( River ) swamp 4 miles ( 6 km ) from the river , and there is no possible chance of crossing the river for the numerous quantity of ice that comes floating down the river every day . We have only traveled 65 miles ( 105 km ) on the last month , including the time spent at this place , which has been about three weeks . It is unknown when we shall cross the river ... '' A soldier from Georgia said : I fought through the War Between the States and have seen many men shot , but the Cherokee Removal was the cruelest work I ever knew . -- Georgian soldier who participated in the removal A Trail of Tears map of Southern Illinois from the USDA -- U.S. Forest Service It eventually took almost three months to cross the 60 miles ( 97 kilometres ) on land between the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers . The trek through southern Illinois is where the Cherokee suffered most of their deaths . However a few years before forced removal , some Cherokee who opted to leave their homes voluntarily chose a water - based route through the Tennessee , Ohio and Mississippi rivers . It took only 21 days , but the Cherokee who were forcibly relocated were weary of water travel . Removed Cherokees initially settled near Tahlequah , Oklahoma . When signing the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 Major Ridge said `` I have signed my death warrant . '' The resulting political turmoil led to the killings of Major Ridge , John Ridge , and Elias Boudinot ; of the leaders of the Treaty Party , only Stand Watie escaped death . The population of the Cherokee Nation eventually rebounded , and today the Cherokees are the largest American Indian group in the United States . There were some exceptions to removal . Approximately 100 Cherokees evaded the U.S. soldiers and lived off the land in Georgia and other states . Those Cherokees who lived on private , individually owned lands ( rather than communally owned tribal land ) were not subject to removal . In North Carolina , about 400 Cherokees , known as the Oconaluftee Cherokee , lived on land in the Great Smoky Mountains owned by a white man named William Holland Thomas ( who had been adopted by Cherokees as a boy ) , and were thus not subject to removal . Added to this were some 200 Cherokee from the Nantahala area allowed to stay in the Qualla Boundary after assisting the U.S. Army in hunting down and capturing the family of the old prophet , Tsali ( who faced a firing squad after capture ) . These North Carolina Cherokees became the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation . Eastern Cherokee restitution ( edit ) The United States Court of Claims ruled in favor of the Eastern Cherokee Tribe 's claim against the U.S. on May 18 , 1905 . This resulted in the appropriation of $1 million ( equal to $27,438,023.04 today ) to the Tribe 's eligible individuals and families . Interior Department employee Guion Miller created a list using several rolls and applications to verify tribal enrollment for the distribution of funds , known as the Guion Miller Roll . The applications received documented over 125,000 individuals ; the court approved more than 30,000 individuals to share in the funds .

Trail of Tears outdoor Historical drama , Unto these Hills ( edit ) A historical drama based on the Trail of Tears , Unto These Hills written by Kermit Hunter , has sold over five million tickets for its performances since its opening on July 1 , 1950 , both touring and at the outdoor Mountainside Theater of the Cherokee Historical Association in Cherokee , North Carolina .

Temple of the Flourishing Law ) is a Buddhist temple that was once one of the powerful Seven Great Temples , in Ikaruga , Nara Prefecture , Japan . Its full name is H\u014dry\u016b Gakumonji ( \u6cd5 \u9686 \u5b66\u554f \u5bfa ) , or Learning Temple of the Flourishing Law , the complex serving as both a seminary and monastery . The temple 's pagoda is widely acknowledged to be one of the oldest wooden buildings existing in the world , underscoring H\u014dry\u016b - ji 's place as one of the most celebrated temples in Japan . In 1993 , H\u014dry\u016b - ji was inscribed together with Hokki - ji as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name Buddhist Monuments in the H\u014dry\u016b - ji Area . The Japanese government lists several of its structures , sculptures and artifacts as National Treasures . A 2001 study of its shinbashira , the central wooden column almost suspended inside the T\u014d , concluded the building to be a century older than previously thought .

This first temple is believed to have been completed by 607 . H\u014dry\u016b - ji was dedicated to Yakushi Nyorai , the Buddha of healing and in honor of the prince 's father . Excavations done in 1939 confirmed that Prince Shotoku 's palace , the Ikaruga - no - miya ( \u6591\u9ce9 \u5bae ) , occupied the eastern part of the current temple complex , where the T\u014d - in ( \u6771\u9662 ) sits today . Also discovered were the ruins of a temple complex which was southwest of the prince 's palace and not completely within the present temple complex . The original temple , named by modern historians and archaeologists Wakakusa - garan ( \u82e5\u8349 \u4f3d\u85cd ) , was lost , probably burned to the ground after being hit by lightning in 670 . The temple was reconstructed but slightly reoriented in a northwest position , which is believed to have been completed by around 711 . The temple was repaired and reassembled in the early twelfth century , in 1374 , and 1603 . In 1950 the maintainers of the temple broke away from the Hoss\u014d sect . The owners currently call the temple the headquarters of the `` Sh\u014dtoku '' sect . Reconstruction controversy ( edit ) After the long controversy ignited by architecture historian Sekino in 1905 , the majority consensus view as of 2006 is that the current precinct is a reconstruction . The excavations in 1939 that uncovered the older temple site including architectural remains of a Kond\u014d and a pagoda , are accepted as conclusive proof . The original complex , Wakakusa - garan , probably burned down , but there is still a debate as to whether a fire actually occurred in 670 , as recorded in the Nihon Shoki , or whether there was another reason . Architecture ( edit ) The Ch\u016bmon ( Inner Gate ) with its entasis columns Buddhist Monuments in the H\u014dry\u016b - ji Area Closer look of wooden carving in Buddhist Monuments in the H\u014dry\u016b - ji Area . Present complex ( edit ) The current temple is made up of two areas , the Sai - in ( \u897f\u9662 ) in the west and the T\u014d - in ( \u6771\u9662 ) in the east . The western part of the temple contains the Kond\u014d ( \u91d1\u5802 , sanctuary Hall ) and the temple 's five - story pagoda . The T\u014d - in area holds the octagonal Yumedono Hall ( \u5922\u6bbf , Hall of Dreams ) and sits 122 meters east of the Sai - in area . The complex also contains monk 's quarters , lecture halls , libraries , and dining halls . Characteristics ( edit ) The belfry of the East Precinct The reconstructed buildings embrace significant cultural influences from the Three Kingdoms of Korea , particularly those of Baekje , as well as from Eastern Han to Northern Wei of China . The Chinese influence comes via Baekje , since Baekje had permanent trading relation with China . With its origin dating back to early 7th century , the reconstruction has allowed H\u014dry\u016b - ji to absorb and feature a unique fusion of early Asuka period style elements , added with some distinct ones only seen in H\u014dry\u016b - ji . There are many features that suggest the current precinct of H\u014dryu - ji is entirely not related to the Asuka period style ( a style that seems nonexistent ) . Pagoda ( edit ) The pagoda has certain characteristics unique to H\u014dry\u016b - ji The five - storey pagoda , located in Sai - in area , stands at 32.45 meters in height ( 122 feet ) and is approximately 20X20 in width and is one of the oldest wooden buildings in the world . The wood used in the center pillar of the pagoda is estimated through a dendrochronological analysis to have been felled in 594 . The central pillar rests three meters below the surface of the massive foundation stone , stretching into the ground . At its base is enshrined what is believed to be a fragment of one of Buddha 's bones . Around it , four sculpted scenes from the life of the Buddha face north , east , south and west . Although the pagoda is five - storied , there is no access to the interior ; it is rather designed to inspire people with its external view . Kond\u014d ( edit ) The kond\u014d The kond\u014d , located side - by - side to the Pagoda in Sai - in , is another one of the oldest wood buildings extant in the world . The hall measures 18.5 meters by 15.2 meters . The hall is two storied , with roofs curved in the corners but only the first story has a double roof ( \u88f3 \u968e mokoshi ) . This was added later in the Nara period with extra posts to hold up the original first roof because it extended more than four meters past the building . Due to a fire that broke out on January 26 , 1949 , severe damage was caused to the building , mainly its first floor , and the murals . As a result of the restoration ( completed in 1954 ) , it is estimated that about fifteen to twenty percent of the original seventh century Kondo materials is left in the current building , while the charred members were carefully removed and rebuilt to a separate fireproof warehouse for future research . Through a recent dendrochronological analysis carried out using the materials preserved during the restorations done in the 1950s , it has turned out that some of them were felled prior to 670 , suggesting a possibility that the current kond\u014d was already under construction when `` the fire in 670 '' , as recorded in the Nihon Shoki , burned the former Wakakusa - garan down . The hall holds the famous Shaka Triad , together with a bronze Yakushi and Amida Nyorai statues , and other national treasures . The wall paintings shown today in the Kond\u014d are a reproduction from 1967 . Yumedono , a hall associated with Prince Sh\u014dtoku Yumedono ( hall of Dreams ) ( edit ) Yumedono is one of the main constructions in the T\u014d - in area , built on the ground which was once Prince Sh\u014dtoku 's private palace , Ikaruga no miya . The present incarnation of this hall was built in 739 to assuage the Prince 's spirit . The hall acquired its present - day common name in the Heian period , after a legend that says a Buddha arrived as Prince Sh\u014dtoku and meditated in a hall that existed here . The hall also contains the famous Yumedono Kannon ( also Kuse - , or Guze Kannon ) ; which is only displayed at certain times of the year . Treasures ( edit ) The treasures of the temple are considered to be a time capsule of Buddhist art from the sixth and seventh century . Much of the frescoes , statues , and other pieces of art within the temple , as well as the architecture of the temple 's buildings themselves show the strong cultural influence from China , Korea and India and demonstrated the international connection of the countries of East Asia . The Tokyo National Museum holds over 300 objects which were donated to the Imperial Household by H\u014dryu - ji in 1878 . Some of these items are on public display , and all are available for study as part of the museum 's digital collection . Kudara Kannon ( edit ) Kudara Kannon Kudara Kannon ( lit . Baekje Guanyin ) is one of the best representative Buddhist sculptures in the Asuka period , with Guze Kannon in Yumedono . Probably made in the early -- middle 7th century . It is 209cm in height and has a quite slim figure . While frontality is a prominent characteristic of the Shaka Triad by Tori Busshi , this statue intends to be seen rather from a side . Most parts of it are made of Cinnamomum camphora . Initially some parts , such as its bare body , were finished with lacquer , and colored vividly , but now severely damaged . The origin of the statue is veiled in mystery . Ancient catalogs for H\u014dry\u016bji 's treasures , even one written in the late Kamakura period , never mention it . The first surviving record ( \u6cd5\u9686\u5bfa \u8af8 \u5802 \u4ecf \u8eb0 \u6570\u91cf \u8a18 ) which referred to it , was from 1698 C.E. , and which implies that it was moved from somewhere sometime after the Kamakura period . The record calls it Kok\u016bz\u014d Bosatsu ( \u0100k\u0101\u015bagarbha Bodhisattva ) , not Kannon Bosatsu ( Guanyin ) , and says `` it came from Baekje , but was made in India . '' At least in the Edo period , there remained no record anymore about which temple it came from , but only a somewhat made - up legend . Although it is called confusingly Kudara Kannon today , the name can not date back to before the early 20th century . All documents from the Edo period to the Meiji period left in H\u014dry\u016bji , and its oral tradition had regarded it as Kok\u016bz\u014d Bosatsu . The research record made by the Japanese government in 1886 , however , named it in the Korean manner Kannon ( \u671d\u9bae \u98a8 \u89b3\u97f3 ) at the first time , which was probably suggested by Okakura Tenshin . In 1911 , the crown with the curved Amitabha , a typical attribute for Kannon , for this statue was found in a storehouse of H\u014dry\u016bji , and thus it proved undoubtedly to be Kannon . The name Kudara Kannon firstly appeared in a book published in 1917 . It said it was `` A tradition of the temple to call the statue Kudara Kannon , '' although there was no such tradition was handed down in fact . Today it is widely accepted by the authorities that the statue was made in Japan . The chief reasons are , in the first place , it is made of Cinnamomum camphora , which was a very typical medium for Japanese Buddhist sculptures in the 7th century . On the other hand , there are no example made of this wood found in Korea . In the second place , the style of flower ornaments in the crown closely resemble those of Guze Kannon and the Four Devas in the Kond\u014d . The origin of the style is still controversial and has no consensus . From the South dynasty ( Kobayashi , Mochizuki etc . ) , from Northern Qi , Northern Zhou or Sui dynasty ( Ueno , Machida etc . ) are all possibilities . The scantiness of surviving Chinese Buddhist sculptures makes it difficult . Murals ( edit ) Amidhaba paradise before fire The murals of the kond\u014d comprise fifty walls ; four larger walls , eight mid-sized walls and thirty - eight small wall areas inside the building . The original murals were removed after the fire incident in 1949 and are kept in a non-public treasure house . Twenty small wall paintings , unscathed from the 1949 fire , are in their original places while reproductions replaced the parts that were removed due to damage . It is generally believed that the paintings on the large walls represent the Pure Land ( \u6d44\u571f j\u014ddo ) with Shaka , Amida , Miroku and Yakushi Nyorai Buddhas . Some of the artistic choices , including the way the robes are modeled , are similar to murals found in Ajanta Caves ( India ) or Dunhuang ( China . ) Also observed are Tang and Indian flavors of the Bosatsu and Kannon drawn on the sides of the Amida . Judging from the early Tang influences , the present day consensus on the time of creation of the paintings is end of 7th century . Thus ruling out the possibilities of authorship by those early 7th century figures who were once believed to be the creator , e.g. Tori or Donch\u014d , there is no clear or accepted author of this work . Shaka triad ( edit ) Tori Busshi is credited with the casting of this massive Buddhist statue . It is a triad and so Sakyamuni , the center Buddha , is attended by two other figures , Bhaisajyaguru to its right and Amit\u0101bha to its left . The statues are dated to 623 and the style originates in Northern Wei art . The style of the statue is also known as Tori style and is characterized by the two - dimensionality of the figure and the repetitive pattern - like depictions of the cloth the triad sits upon . At each corner of the triad stand four wooden Shitenn\u014d statues from the end of the Asuka period . They are the oldest examples of Shitenn\u014d statues in Japan . Tamamushi shrine ( edit ) The Tamamushi Shrine , Tamamushi - no - zushi , a miniature shrine once decorated with the iridescent wings of the tamamushi beetle ( Chrysochroa fulgidissima ) Further information : Tamamushi Shrine The Tamamushi Shrine is a common example of painting that derived from Baekje and provides important evidence for the Korean peninsula 's and the Chinese mainland 's strong cultural transfer to the Japanese islands . The shrine is named for the many wings of the tamamushi beetle that once adorned it but have since deteriorated . The paintings that cover building and dais are of Jataka tales , bodhisattvas , the Four Heavenly Kings , and other buddhist iconography . The front panels of the building show the Four Guardian Kings clad in armor with long flowing scarves . On the side doors are bodhisattvas holding lotus blossoms and forming a mudra . On the back is represented a sacred landscape with heights topped with pagodas . The dais shows on its front relics , seated monks making offerings , and apsara . On the back is depicted Mount Sumeru . The right side shows a scene from the Nirvana Sutra , where the Buddha offers his life in return for more of the sacred teachings , before being caught in his plummet by Indra . On the left panel of the dais is a scene from the Golden Light Sutra of a bodhisattva removing his upper garments before casting himself from a cliff to feed a hungry tigress and her cubs . Yakushi Nyorai ( edit ) The statue of Yakushi of the original temple was saved during the fire of 670 . While the temple was being rebuilt the Shaka Triad was commissioned or had been already cast . Yumedono ( Guze ) Kannon ( edit ) This Kannon is a statue that supposedly is the representation of Prince Shotoku . It is approximate six feet and one inch and some sources believe that Shotoku was that height . It is 197 centimeters in height . The kannon is made of gilded wood . It is suggested that the statue was made to assuage the dead prince 's spirit based on the fact that the halo was attached to the statue by a nail driven through the head . The statue bears a close resemblance to extant portraiture of the prince . The Kannon retains most of its gilt . It is in superb condition because it was kept in the Dream Hall and wrapped in five hundred meters of cloth and never viewed in sunlight . The statue was held to be sacred and was never seen until it was unwrapped at the demand of Ernest Fenollosa , who was charged by the Japanese government to catalogue the art of the state and later became a curator at the Boston Museum of Fine Art . Art historians suggest that this figure is based on the Tori Busshi style .

The last line is a complete Sanskrit syllabary in Siddha\u1e43 script Serving the needs of architectural research ( edit ) The Nihon Shoki records the arrival of a carpenter and a buddhist sculptor in 577 , along with the monks , from Baekje to Japan , which is an underlying fact of importing the mainland expertise through this Korean kingdom with whom Japan enjoyed close relations , in order to build temples locally . These experts are recorded to have stationed in Naniwa , or present - day Osaka , where the Shitenn\u014d - ji was built . There is no record , on the other hand , as to who exactly were the people that have engaged in the constructing of H\u014dry\u016b - ji , although the Nihon Shoki records the existence of 46 temples in 624 . The bracket work of H\u014dry\u016b - ji resembles that of the partial remainder of a miniature Baekje gilt bronze pagoda .

The first tickets were purchased on October 3 , 1985 .

Accordingly , the Lottery was required to provide at least 34 % of its revenues to public education , supplementing ( not replacing ) other funds provided by California . Another 50 % of its revenues must be paid to the public in the form of prizes , making a mandated minimum of 84 % of all funds that must be given back to the public in the form of prizes or funds for public education . The remainder , a maximum of 16 % , was to be spent on administration , such as salaries and running the games . On April 8 , 2010 , Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law Bill 142 ( Hayashi , D - Hayward ) . Amending the Lottery Act , this bill reallocates Lottery revenues `` so as to maximize the amount of funding allocated to public education . '' As an urgency statute , this bill took effect immediately . The new allocation increased to at least 87 % the portion of Lottery revenue returned to the public , and correspondingly decreased to a maximum of 13 % the amount spent on administration . It then specified that `` not less than 50 % of the total annual Lottery revenues , in an amount to be determined by the commission , be returned to the public in the form of prizes . '' This leaves `` the commission to establish the percentage to be allocated to the benefit of public education at a level that maximizes the total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education . '' It also imposed requirements `` to ensure continued growth in Lottery net revenues allocated to public education '' , with annual procedures that would , `` in any one of the first 5 full fiscal years after the enactment of this measure , ... provide for the repeal of the changes made by this measure on the following January 1 , and the prior law to be restored '' , if those requirements were not then met . This bill follows the practice of `` other large state lottery systems , including Texas , North Carolina , and Florida , which have shown an increase in revenue through similar changes . '' Commission ( edit ) The Lottery Act mandates a five - member commission , appointed by the governor , to `` oversee the Lottery and the Director '' and make quarterly reports `` to the Governor , the Attorney General , the Controller , the Treasurer , and the Legislature . '' Annually the commission selects a chairperson . Regular meetings of the commission are held at least quarterly and are open to the public . On January 29 , 1985 , Gov. George Deukmejian appointed the first Lottery commissioners : William Johnston , Laverta Montgomery , John Price , Howard Varner , and Kennard Webster . Deukmejian appointed the first director , Mark Michalko , formerly Ohio Lottery legal counsel , in May 1985 . On 12 March 2012 , Governor Jerry Brown appointed Gregory J. Ahern to the Commission , who was also elected as Sheriff of Alameda County in 2006 . History ( edit ) The California State Lottery began on November 6 , 1984 , when a majority ( 58 % ) of California voters passed Proposition 37 , the California State Lottery Act of 1984 , authorizing the creation of a lottery . On January 29 , 1985 , Gov. George Deukmejian appointed the first Lottery commissioners : William Johnston , Laverta Montgomery , John Price , Howard Varner , and Kennard Webster . The Lottery Act mandated an extremely tight timeline for establishing the Lottery and bringing it to operational status . To comply , the state government immediately built the Lottery 's original headquarters in only three months in the Richards neighborhood of Sacramento ( just north of downtown ) , where it has been located ever since . Governor Deukmejian appointed the Lottery 's first director , Mark Michalko , formerly Ohio Lottery legal counsel , in May 1985 . The first lottery games were Scratchers ; sales began on October 3 , 1985 . A weekly Lotto game began on October 14 , 1986 . In 1996 , as a result of a lawsuit by Indian tribes , the Supreme Court of California unanimously struck down the lottery 's implementation of keno , ruling that it was a house - banked game , not a lottery game , which at that time was illegal anywhere in California . In her opinion for the court , Associate Justice Kathryn Werdegar explained that the California Penal Code and case law interpreting the Penal Code have traditionally distinguished between a `` lottery '' and a `` banked game '' or `` banking game , '' and it was the intent of the state electorate in enacting the Lottery Act to allow only a `` lottery . '' In a true `` lottery '' , the players play against each other ; in a `` banked game '' , they play each other and against the house . The critical distinction between the two is that a bank in a `` banked game '' can be broken based purely upon whether each of the individual bets is won or lost ; the house unconditionally promises to pay prizes on all winning bets with no maximum ceiling . The high court explained that while this definition of a lottery does not prohibit fixed - prize lotteries , such lotteries are valid only if the total prize amount and the maximum number of fixed prizes to be won are fixed before the draw . Subsequently , California Attorney General Dan Lungren also ruled that Daily 3 , which at the time had fixed payouts , also was illegal because it created an interest on the part of the state that fewer people should win , contrary to a lottery where the operator has no stake in the outcome of the draw . In response to these rulings , the Lottery modified Keno and created Hot Spot , which has a pari - mutuel payout format , and modified Daily 3 to a pari - mutuel format where payouts vary depending on the number of individuals who picked the winning numbers . California joined Mega Millions on June 22 , 2005 ; it became the 12th jurisdiction to offer the game , and the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion with MUSL . A Mega Millions drawing was held in Hollywood to commemorate the event . In September 2011 , the California Lottery moved into a new $58 million headquarters at 700 North 10th Street across the street from the old one , which it promptly demolished . Because it was built in a frantic 90 - day rush to comply with the Lottery Act , the original headquarters had numerous construction defects in the roof , foundation , and elevator , as well as a mold problem . California , while initially never desiring to offer Mega Millions 's rival Powerball , was briefly a member of the Multi-State Lottery Association ( MUSL ) because an `` international '' lottery game that would have included a number of US lotteries was planned ; however , the game never came to fruition . However , in February 2012 the California Lottery initiated an impact analysis of the Powerball game , in preparation for a recommendation in July 2012 . Subsequently , the Fiscal Year 2012 -- 2013 Business Plan included funding for a launch of Powerball within the fiscal year , with Powerball launching in California on April 8 , 2013 . As a result of the California Supreme Court 's decision , California is the only state with variable payouts for both games . Current draw games ( edit ) In - house draw games ( edit ) Daily 3 ( edit ) Playing Daily 3 involves picking three digits 0 through 9 and a playstyle . Bettors can choose Quick Pick to have the numbers picked randomly by computer . The playstyle choices are straight ( this is the default if the player does n't choose one ) box , or straight \/ box . The game costs $1 per play , per draw , and the Advance Play option allows up to 14 consecutive draws . There are two draws every day , televised at 1 : 29pm and 6 : 59pm . Daily 4 ( edit ) A `` pick 4 '' type game premiered on May 19 , 2008 . Each play costs $1 and drawings are held once per day . Playstyles , like `` Daily 3 '' . Daily Derby ( edit ) A Daily Derby is a mock horse racing game . Players choose three horses out of 12 , one each to finish first ( win ) , second ( place ) and third ( show ) ; players also choose a race time from 1 : 40 : 00 to 1 : 49 : 99 , by marking the last three digits of the time on the playslip . Alternately , players can select Quick Pick to have the computer choose the horses , the race time , or both . Daily Derby also offers Advance Play for up to 14 consecutive draws . The game costs $2 per play , per draw ; held daily at 6 : 35pm and televised at 6 : 59pm . Fantasy 5 ( edit ) Fantasy 5 players choose five numbers from 1 through 39 . A ticket includes up to five sets of numbers ; they can be played up to 12 drawings . Games cost $1 per play . Fantasy 5 is drawn evenings at 6 : 35pm and televised at 6 : 59pm . Jackpots begin at $65,000 . A player who bought a $5 Fantasy 5 ticket used to get a coupon to mail in for a `` second - chance '' drawing to be on the Make Me A Millionaire show , or to play the Dream Machine on the first TV show , The Big Spin . That drawing was cancelled in July 2010 and now players receive a `` second - chance '' coupon with a twenty digit code . Players can enter those codes at www.calottery.com\/fan5 to be entered into a weekly drawing for a cash prize ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 . SuperLotto Plus ( edit ) SuperLotto Plus is a lotto game played in the style of Mega Millions . SuperLotto Plus is drawn every Wednesday and Saturday . The game began in 1986 as California Super Lotto . In 2000 , the name was changed to SuperLotto Plus . Its starting jackpot is $7 million ( annuitized ) ; a cash option is available for jackpot winners . While the cash option usually is chosen , the SuperLotto Plus annuity is graduated . As of the May 11 , 2013 drawing , the advertised annuity jackpot represents a 30 - payment graduated annuity stream , similar to that of Mega Millions , partly in response to low long - term interest rates . The cash value is now guaranteed . The graduated payments begin at 1.81 % of the jackpot amount and rise exponentially such that the final payout is 5.56 % ( more than triple that of the first payment ) of the advertised jackpot amount . Previously , the first payment was 2.5 % of the annuity value ( or share ) of the jackpot , with the second installment 2.7 % . The remaining 24 payments increased by 0.1 percentage point yearly , so that the final ( 26th ) installment represented 5.1 % of the annuity . Five numbers are selected from a set of 47 balls , while a Mega Number is chosen from a second set , of 27 balls . ( This Mega Number is not to be confused with the gold - colored ball in Mega Millions , which also is known as the Mega Number . ) The California Lottery has offered a number of jackpot games , beginning with its `` 6 - 49 '' game in 1986 , which became a 53 - number game ( drawing a seventh , `` bonus '' ball ) in 1990 , then changed again , to a 51 - number game . The current variant , 5 \/ 47 + 1 \/ 27 , began in 2000 . On February 16 , 2002 , the California Lottery 's then - highest payout of $193 million was split by three tickets . Other big jackpots include $72 million in 2007 and $56 million in 1995 . Hot Spot ( edit ) Hot Spot is a quick - draw keno style game . The game was updated on August 1 , 2011 , to allow players to choose to play any amount of `` spots '' from 1 through 10 from a pool of numbers from 01 through 80 . A new higher top prize of $100,000 was also offered for 10 spot play . Previously , players could only choose to play 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 8 spots . Wagering can be either $1 , $2 , $3 , $4 , $5 , $10 , or $20 , for a maximum of 100 consecutive draws . In addition , players can choose a Bulls - Eye wager for each draw , hoping to hit the 1 number out of the 20 numbers drawn that is selected as the bulls - eye number . Drawings occur every day and every four minutes from 6 : 00 am until 2 : 00 am . Lottery retailers have monitors that display Hot Spot drawings and recent results from other Lottery games . Fixed prizes are awarded . To meet the pari - mutuel requirements , a continuous `` wagered prize fund '' is created from 63 % of gross sales , which ensures that the fixed payouts are met under normal circumstances , and calls for reductions should an unusually large number of individuals win a particular prize . If the wagered prize fund exceeds $2.9 million , prize augmentation and promotions are created to distribute the excess funds . Multi-jurisdictional games ( edit ) Mega Millions ( edit ) Main article : Mega Millions In 2004 , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , as part of his redesign of California government , suggested that California join a multi-jurisdictional lottery . In June 2005 , the Lottery Commission voted to join Mega Millions . California is unique among the 45 Mega Millions participants in that all nine prize levels for Mega Millions within its borders are always parimutuel , rather than each non-jackpot prize having a set value . This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions . For example , the `` advertised '' second prize in Mega Millions is $1,000,000 ; it is not unheard of for that prize level to pay over $1.9 million to a California second - prize winner . The second prize pool within California frequently rolls ; it is , in effect , a `` secondary jackpot '' . Unlike the other Mega Millions members , California currently does not offer the Megaplier , which is drawn in Texas by a random number generator . Powerball ( edit ) Main article : Powerball In February 2012 , as a response to declining sales and low per - capita revenue from the lottery , California Lottery management initiated a review of whether Powerball would be appropriate for the state . In September 2012 , the Lottery Commission approved management 's request to launch Powerball in April 2013 , citing a net increase in revenue of $90 to $120 million as a result of Powerball , desiring to avoid the launch of a $20 scratcher in fall 2013 . Since the Lottery Act requires that Lottery staff be present at all draws , two part - time employees audit the Powerball draws , which are held at a studio in Tallahassee , Florida . In November 2012 , California promulgated the regulations for Powerball in the state . Similar to Mega Millions , all non jackpot draws in the state are within an intrastate pool , with California sending its jackpot share ( 30 % of draw sales ) to MUSL for addition to the multi-state jackpot pool . This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions . Each pool for a particular prize category will rollover , thus the `` pick 5 '' prize will create a secondary jackpot similar to the `` pick 5 '' payout in California 's implementation of Mega Millions . Also , as a result of the California Supreme Court ruling which mandates pari - mutuel payouts , California will not participate in the PowerPlay multiplier option . California launched Powerball on April 8 , 2013 , with the first drawing on April 10 , 2013 . The marketing budget was $8.4 million , and included experiential `` red balls '' placed at various locations within the state and television , radio , and online advertising . Former games ( edit ) Draw games ( edit ) Little Lotto : A pick 6 - out - of - 39 game with a fixed top prize of $500,000 . Decco : Played in a similar fashion as most US `` pick - 4 '' drawing games , except players had to match one playing card ( 2 through Ace ) in each of the four suits . Topper : Each SuperLotto Plus ticket automatically was printed with the names of three of California 's 100 then-most - populous - cities ( e.g. Los Angeles , San Diego , Sacramento ) . If the player wagered an additional $1 , they were eligible to win up to $25,000 in the Topper drawing , which was drawn by random number generator . Raffle ( edit ) The California Lottery offered two raffles ; March 17 , 2007 and one on January 1 , 2008 . The raffles offered the best chance to win a $1 million prize , as well as various smaller prizes , and were designed to respond to lottery players ' complaints that many million dollar prizes be offered instead of a few larger prizes . However , the raffles did not sell out , and were not repeated . TV game shows ( edit ) The California Lottery has had two TV game shows . The Big Spin ( edit ) The Big Spin , the California Lottery 's first game show , broadcast its final episode on January 10 , 2009 , ending its run as the longest - running lottery game show in the US . The Lottery had several methods for choosing contestants , including prizes in Scratchers games and `` second - chance '' drawings from other games . The top prize was fixed at $3 million ; the minimum guaranteed prize was $1,750 . While Big Spin Scratchers remained in circulation in 2009 , winners who would previously have spun the wheel on The Big Spin had the option to spin the wheel -- untelevised -- as an alternative to going to the Make Me a Millionaire show , which succeeded The Big Spin . Following the show 's ending in 2009 , the California Lottery commission deemed the wheel to be too historic to salvage , and decided to preserve The Big Spin wheel as part of a permanent exhibit at their headquarters in Sacramento . Guests are invited to spin the wheel for fun without cash prizes . Make Me a Millionaire ( edit ) Make Me a Millionaire , the California Lottery 's second TV game show , debuted on January 17 , 2009 , for an initial four - year run with host Mark L. Walberg and co-presenter Liz Hernandez . On May 4 , 2010 , the California Lottery announced the show 's cancellation due to poor ratings , with the last program telecast on July 3 , 2010 . The show will not be replaced ; money that was allocated for its production will be used for prizes for the Lottery 's Scratchers games . Players qualified for the Make Me a Millionaire show by winning in the `` Make Me a Millionaire '' Scratchers game , or by a Fantasy 5 second - chance drawing ; when the show began , winners from `` Big Spin '' Scratchers also qualified . After the TV show was canceled , winners of the `` Make Me a Millionaire '' Scratchers games , which were sold until June 25 , 2010 , had until December 22 , 2010 , to claim their opportunities to play and win prizes off the air . Similarly , Fantasy 5 second - chance draw coupons , which were discontinued on July 4 , 2010 , could be submitted by December 31 , 2010 . Five unaired episodes of Make Me A Millionaire were produced and made available for viewing on the Lottery 's YouTube channel . During the game play , each of the 12 contestants won at least $2,000 ; seven of the contestants were selected randomly to play four different games of chance with a top prize of at least $1 million . The first game , Lucky Penny , gave three players a minimum prize of $2,000 and the possibility of winning a car . The second game is Safe Cracker , in which two players competed for prizes ranging from $2,000 to $92,000 . Next is California Cool , with one player and prizes ranging from $5,000 to $200,000 . The last game is Millionaire , also for one player ; it guaranteed $10,000 with a jackpot that began at $1 million , increasing by $200,000 each week until won . Scratchers ( edit ) California sells scratch cards under the branding `` Scratchers '' . The prizes are smaller than other lottery games , but there are better odds ( averaging 1 : 5 ) . There are dozens of Scratchers games on sale at any time , and the selection of games changes frequently . Winners must be claimed within 180 days of the announced end - of - game date . Scratchers range in price from $1 to $10 . A $20 scratcher , `` $5 Million Jackpot '' , was introduced September 25 , 2013 . To commemorate the Lottery 's 30th anniversary , on August 24th , 2015 , a $30 Scratcher `` California Lottery 30th Anniversary '' was launched . Claiming prizes ( edit ) For each prize of less than $600 , players may collect from either a Lottery retailer or the Lottery itself . Prizes of $600 or more must be collected from the Lottery , via claim form . Claim period ( edit ) Almost all prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the draw or the announced end of the game . If the 180th day is a weekend or holiday , the final claim date is extended to the next business day . Any unclaimed prize money is transferred to the education fund in addition to the minimum 34 % that the Lottery is already obligated to transfer from income . Because many of the 44 Mega Millions participants have a one - year claim period , the California legislature changed the language in the Lottery Act . On April 23 , 2008 , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed Assembly Member Van Tran 's Assembly Bill 1251 , modifying California Government Code section 8880.321 to allow for a one - year claim period for a Mega Millions jackpot prize . This is the only prize in California that has a one - year claim period . All other prizes have the 180 - day claim period . This legislation affected Mega Millions drawings after July 5 , 2008 . Payment options ( edit ) All prizes for Fantasy 5 , Daily Derby , Daily 3 , Daily 4 , and non-jackpot SuperLotto Plus , Mega Millions , and Powerball prizes , are paid out in one payment , less 25 % or 33 % ( depending upon the winner 's tax documentation ) Federal withholding if the prize is over $5,000 . Merchandise prizes over $5,000 are subject to 33 % Federal withholding . Scratchers tickets are generally one - payment prizes ; however , some games have annuity options for payments each year , or per week . California does not tax California Lottery winnings , however it taxes lottery winnings from other jurisdictions . For SuperLotto Plus and Mega Millions jackpots , the player may choose a single cash payout for a floating percentage of the jackpot , or an annuity . The SuperLotto Plus , Mega Millions , and Powerball payment schedule are on a graduated basis over 30 annual payments . Until 2005 , when California joined Mega Millions , the payment choice on SuperLotto Plus had to be made when the ticket was bought . Since then , there is a 60 - day window after winning , in which the choice of cash or annuity is to be made . Unclaimed prizes ( edit ) Unclaimed prizes remaining after the claim period expires always go to supporting California 's public schools . As of the end of FY 2013 -- 14 , a total of $793.5 in unclaimed prizes have been awarded to education .

Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in shape , area , and volume in response to a change in temperature . Temperature is a monotonic function of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance . When a substance is heated , the kinetic energy of its molecules increases . Thus , the molecules begin vibrating \/ moving more and usually maintain a greater average separation . Materials which contract with increasing temperature are unusual ; this effect is limited in size , and only occurs within limited temperature ranges ( see examples below ) . The relative expansion ( also called strain ) divided by the change in temperature is called the material 's coefficient of thermal expansion and generally varies with temperature .

Contraction effects ( negative thermal expansion ) ( edit ) A number of materials contract on heating within certain temperature ranges ; this is usually called negative thermal expansion , rather than `` thermal contraction '' . For example , the coefficient of thermal expansion of water drops to zero as it is cooled to 3.983 \u00b0 C and then becomes negative below this temperature ; this means that water has a maximum density at this temperature , and this leads to bodies of water maintaining this temperature at their lower depths during extended periods of sub-zero weather . Also , fairly pure silicon has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 and 120 kelvins . Factors affecting thermal expansion ( edit ) Unlike gases or liquids , solid materials tend to keep their shape when undergoing thermal expansion . Thermal expansion generally decreases with increasing bond energy , which also has an effect on the melting point of solids , so , high melting point materials are more likely to have lower thermal expansion . In general , liquids expand slightly more than solids . The thermal expansion of glasses is higher compared to that of crystals . At the glass transition temperature , rearrangements that occur in an amorphous material lead to characteristic discontinuities of coefficient of thermal expansion and specific heat . These discontinuities allow detection of the glass transition temperature where a supercooled liquid transforms to a glass . Absorption or desorption of water ( or other solvents ) can change the size of many common materials ; many organic materials change size much more due to this effect than due to thermal expansion . Common plastics exposed to water can , in the long term , expand by many percent . Coefficient of thermal expansion ( edit ) The coefficient of thermal expansion describes how the size of an object changes with a change in temperature . Specifically , it measures the fractional change in size per degree change in temperature at a constant pressure . Several types of coefficients have been developed : volumetric , area , and linear . The choice of coefficient depends on the particular application and which dimensions are considered important . For solids , one might only be concerned with the change along a length , or over some area . The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient is the most basic thermal expansion coefficient , and the most relevant for fluids . In general , substances expand or contract when their temperature changes , with expansion or contraction occurring in all directions . Substances that expand at the same rate in every direction are called isotropic . For isotropic materials , the area and volumetric thermal expansion coefficient are , respectively , approximately twice and three times larger than the linear thermal expansion coefficient . Mathematical definitions of these coefficients are defined below for solids , liquids , and gases . General volumetric thermal expansion coefficient ( edit ) In the general case of a gas , liquid , or solid , the volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion is given by \u03b1 V = 1 V ( \u2202 V \u2202 T ) p ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( V ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( V ) ) \\ , \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( \\ partial V ) ( \\ partial T ) ) \\ right ) _ ( p ) ) The subscript p indicates that the pressure is held constant during the expansion , and the subscript V stresses that it is the volumetric ( not linear ) expansion that enters this general definition . In the case of a gas , the fact that the pressure is held constant is important , because the volume of a gas will vary appreciably with pressure as well as temperature . For a gas of low density this can be seen from the ideal gas law . Expansion in solids ( edit ) When calculating thermal expansion it is necessary to consider whether the body is free to expand or is constrained . If the body is free to expand , the expansion or strain resulting from an increase in temperature can be simply calculated by using the applicable coefficient of Thermal Expansion . If the body is constrained so that it can not expand , then internal stress will be caused ( or changed ) by a change in temperature . This stress can be calculated by considering the strain that would occur if the body were free to expand and the stress required to reduce that strain to zero , through the stress \/ strain relationship characterised by the elastic or Young 's modulus . In the special case of solid materials , external ambient pressure does not usually appreciably affect the size of an object and so it is not usually necessary to consider the effect of pressure changes . Common engineering solids usually have coefficients of thermal expansion that do not vary significantly over the range of temperatures where they are designed to be used , so where extremely high accuracy is not required , practical calculations can be based on a constant , average , value of the coefficient of expansion . Linear expansion ( edit ) Change in length of a rod due to thermal expansion . Linear expansion means change in one dimension ( length ) as opposed to change in volume ( volumetric expansion ) . To a first approximation , the change in length measurements of an object due to thermal expansion is related to temperature change by a `` linear expansion coefficient '' . It is the fractional change in length per degree of temperature change . Assuming negligible effect of pressure , we may write : \u03b1 L = 1 L d L d T ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( L ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( L ) ) \\ , ( \\ frac ( dL ) ( dT ) ) ) where L ( \\ displaystyle L ) is a particular length measurement and d L \/ d T ( \\ displaystyle dL \/ dT ) is the rate of change of that linear dimension per unit change in temperature . The change in the linear dimension can be estimated to be : \u0394 L L = \u03b1 L \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ frac ( \\ Delta L ) ( L ) ) = \\ alpha _ ( L ) \\ Delta T ) This equation works well as long as the linear - expansion coefficient does not change much over the change in temperature \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta T ) , and the fractional change in length is small \u0394 L \/ L \u226a 1 ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta L \/ L \\ ll 1 ) . If either of these conditions does not hold , the equation must be integrated . Effects on strain ( edit ) For solid materials with a significant length , like rods or cables , an estimate of the amount of thermal expansion can be described by the material strain , given by \u03b5 t h e r m a l ( \\ displaystyle \\ epsilon _ ( \\ mathrm ( thermal ) ) ) and defined as : \u03b5 t h e r m a l = ( L f i n a l \u2212 L i n i t i a l ) L i n i t i a l ( \\ displaystyle \\ epsilon _ ( \\ mathrm ( thermal ) ) = ( \\ frac ( ( L_ ( \\ mathrm ( final ) ) - L_ ( \\ mathrm ( initial ) ) ) ) ( L_ ( \\ mathrm ( initial ) ) ) ) ) where L i n i t i a l ( \\ displaystyle L_ ( \\ mathrm ( initial ) ) ) is the length before the change of temperature and L f i n a l ( \\ displaystyle L_ ( \\ mathrm ( final ) ) ) is the length after the change of temperature . For most solids , thermal expansion is proportional to the change in temperature : \u03b5 t h e r m a l \u221d \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ epsilon _ ( \\ mathrm ( thermal ) ) \\ propto \\ Delta T ) Thus , the change in either the strain or temperature can be estimated by : \u03b5 t h e r m a l = \u03b1 L \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ epsilon _ ( \\ mathrm ( thermal ) ) = \\ alpha _ ( L ) \\ Delta T ) where \u0394 T = ( T f i n a l \u2212 T i n i t i a l ) ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta T = ( T_ ( \\ mathrm ( final ) ) - T_ ( \\ mathrm ( initial ) ) ) ) is the difference of the temperature between the two recorded strains , measured in degrees Celsius or kelvins , and \u03b1 L ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( L ) ) is the linear coefficient of thermal expansion in `` per degree Celsius '' or `` per kelvin '' , denoted by \u00b0 C or K , respectively . In the field of continuum mechanics , the thermal expansion and its effects are treated as eigenstrain and eigenstress . Area expansion ( edit ) The area thermal expansion coefficient relates the change in a material 's area dimensions to a change in temperature . It is the fractional change in area per degree of temperature change . Ignoring pressure , we may write : \u03b1 A = 1 A d A d T ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( A ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( A ) ) \\ , ( \\ frac ( dA ) ( dT ) ) ) where A ( \\ displaystyle A ) is some area of interest on the object , and d A \/ d T ( \\ displaystyle dA \/ dT ) is the rate of change of that area per unit change in temperature . The change in the area can be estimated as : \u0394 A A = \u03b1 A \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ frac ( \\ Delta A ) ( A ) ) = \\ alpha _ ( A ) \\ Delta T ) This equation works well as long as the area expansion coefficient does not change much over the change in temperature \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta T ) , and the fractional change in area is small \u0394 A \/ A \u226a 1 ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta A \/ A \\ ll 1 ) . If either of these conditions does not hold , the equation must be integrated . Volume expansion ( edit ) For a solid , we can ignore the effects of pressure on the material , and the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient can be written : \u03b1 V = 1 V d V d T ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( V ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( V ) ) \\ , ( \\ frac ( dV ) ( dT ) ) ) where V ( \\ displaystyle V ) is the volume of the material , and d V \/ d T ( \\ displaystyle dV \/ dT ) is the rate of change of that volume with temperature . This means that the volume of a material changes by some fixed fractional amount . For example , a steel block with a volume of 1 cubic meter might expand to 1.002 cubic meters when the temperature is raised by 50 K . This is an expansion of 0.2 % . If we had a block of steel with a volume of 2 cubic meters , then under the same conditions , it would expand to 2.004 cubic meters , again an expansion of 0.2 % . The volumetric expansion coefficient would be 0.2 % for 50 K , or 0.004 % K . If we already know the expansion coefficient , then we can calculate the change in volume \u0394 V V = \u03b1 V \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ frac ( \\ Delta V ) ( V ) ) = \\ alpha _ ( V ) \\ Delta T ) where \u0394 V \/ V ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta V \/ V ) is the fractional change in volume ( e.g. , 0.002 ) and \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta T ) is the change in temperature ( 50 \u00b0 C ) . The above example assumes that the expansion coefficient did not change as the temperature changed and the increase in volume is small compared to the original volume . This is not always true , but for small changes in temperature , it is a good approximation . If the volumetric expansion coefficient does change appreciably with temperature , or the increase in volume is significant , then the above equation will have to be integrated : ln \u2061 ( V + \u0394 V V ) = \u222b T i T f \u03b1 V ( T ) d T ( \\ displaystyle \\ ln \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( V+ \\ Delta V ) ( V ) ) \\ right ) = \\ int _ ( T_ ( i ) ) ^ ( T_ ( f ) ) \\ alpha _ ( V ) ( T ) \\ , dT ) \u0394 V V = exp \u2061 ( \u222b T i T f \u03b1 V ( T ) d T ) \u2212 1 ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ frac ( \\ Delta V ) ( V ) ) = \\ exp \\ left ( \\ int _ ( T_ ( i ) ) ^ ( T_ ( f ) ) \\ alpha _ ( V ) ( T ) \\ , dT \\ right ) - 1 ) where \u03b1 V ( T ) ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( V ) ( T ) ) is the volumetric expansion coefficient as a function of temperature T , and T i ( \\ displaystyle T_ ( i ) ) , T f ( \\ displaystyle T_ ( f ) ) are the initial and final temperatures respectively . Isotropic materials ( edit ) For isotropic materials the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient is three times the linear coefficient : \u03b1 V = 3 \u03b1 L ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( V ) = 3 \\ alpha _ ( L ) ) This ratio arises because volume is composed of three mutually orthogonal directions . Thus , in an isotropic material , for small differential changes , one - third of the volumetric expansion is in a single axis . As an example , take a cube of steel that has sides of length L. The original volume will be V = L 3 ( \\ displaystyle V = L ^ ( 3 ) ) and the new volume , after a temperature increase , will be V + \u0394 V = ( L + \u0394 L ) 3 = L 3 + 3 L 2 \u0394 L + 3 L \u0394 L 2 + \u0394 L 3 \u2248 L 3 + 3 L 2 \u0394 L = V + 3 V \u0394 L L . ( \\ displaystyle V+ \\ Delta V = ( L+ \\ Delta L ) ^ ( 3 ) = L ^ ( 3 ) + 3L ^ ( 2 ) \\ Delta L + 3L \\ Delta L ^ ( 2 ) + \\ Delta L ^ ( 3 ) \\ approx L ^ ( 3 ) + 3L ^ ( 2 ) \\ Delta L = V + 3V ( \\ Delta L \\ over L ) . ) So \u0394 V V = 3 \u0394 L L = 3 \u03b1 L \u0394 T . ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ frac ( \\ Delta V ) ( V ) ) = 3 ( \\ Delta L \\ over L ) = 3 \\ alpha _ ( L ) \\ Delta T . ) The above approximation holds for small temperature and dimensional changes ( that is , when \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta T ) and \u0394 L ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta L ) are small ) ; but it does not hold if we are trying to go back and forth between volumetric and linear coefficients using larger values of \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta T ) . In this case , the third term ( and sometimes even the fourth term ) in the expression above must be taken into account . Similarly , the area thermal expansion coefficient is two times the linear coefficient : \u03b1 A = 2 \u03b1 L ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( A ) = 2 \\ alpha _ ( L ) ) This ratio can be found in a way similar to that in the linear example above , noting that the area of a face on the cube is just L 2 ( \\ displaystyle L ^ ( 2 ) ) . Also , the same considerations must be made when dealing with large values of \u0394 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ Delta T ) . Anisotropic materials ( edit ) Materials with anisotropic structures , such as crystals ( with less than cubic symmetry , for example martensitic phases ) and many composites , will generally have different linear expansion coefficients \u03b1 L ( \\ displaystyle ( \\ frac ( ) ( ) ) \\ alpha _ ( L ) ) in different directions . As a result , the total volumetric expansion is distributed unequally among the three axes . If the crystal symmetry is monoclinic or triclinic , even the angles between these axes are subject to thermal changes . In such cases it is necessary to treat the coefficient of thermal expansion as a tensor with up to six independent elements . A good way to determine the elements of the tensor is to study the expansion by x-ray powder diffraction . Isobaric expansion in gases ( edit ) For an ideal gas , the volumetric thermal expansion ( i.e. , relative change in volume due to temperature change ) depends on the type of process in which temperature is changed . Two simple cases are constant pressure ( an isobaric process ) and constant volume ( an isochoric process ) . The derivative of the ideal gas law , P V = T ( \\ displaystyle PV = T ) , is P d V + V d P = d T ( \\ displaystyle PdV + VdP = dT ) where P ( \\ displaystyle P ) is the pressure , V ( \\ displaystyle V ) is the specific volume , and T ( \\ displaystyle T ) is temperature measured in energy units . By definition of an isobaric thermal expansion , we have d P = 0 ( \\ displaystyle dP = 0 ) , so that P d V = d T ( \\ displaystyle PdV = dT ) , and the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient is \u03b1 P = C t e \u2261 1 V ( d V d T ) = 1 V ( 1 P ) = 1 P V = 1 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( P = C ^ ( te ) ) \\ equiv ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( V ) ) \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( dV ) ( dT ) ) \\ right ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( V ) ) \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( P ) ) \\ right ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( PV ) ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( T ) ) ) . Similarly , if the volume is held constant , that is if d V = 0 ( \\ displaystyle dV = 0 ) , we have V d P = d T ( \\ displaystyle VdP = dT ) , so that the isochoric thermal expansion is \u03b1 V = C t e \u2261 1 P ( d P d T ) = 1 P ( 1 V ) = 1 P V = 1 T ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha _ ( V = C ^ ( te ) ) \\ equiv ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( P ) ) \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( dP ) ( dT ) ) \\ right ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( P ) ) \\ left ( ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( V ) ) \\ right ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( PV ) ) = ( \\ frac ( 1 ) ( T ) ) ) . Expansion in liquids ( edit ) This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( August 2010 ) Theoretically , the coefficient of linear expansion can be found from the coefficient of volumetric expansion ( \u03b1 \u2248 3\u03b1 ) . For liquids , \u03b1 is calculated through the experimental determination of \u03b1 . Liquids , unlike solids have no definite shape and they take the shape of the container . Consequently , liquids have no definite length and area , so linear and areal expansions of liquids have no significance . Liquids in general , expand on heating . However water is an exception to this general behaviour : Below 4 \u00b0 C it contracts on heating . For higher temperature it shows the normal positive thermal expansion . The thermal expansions of liquid is usually higher than in solids because of weak intermolecular forces present in liquids . Thermal expansion of solids usually shows little dependence on temperature ( except for low temperatures ) whereas liquids expand at different rates at different temperatures . Apparent and absolute expansion of a liquid ( edit ) The expansion of liquids is usually measured in a container . When a liquid expands in a vessel , the vessel expands along with the liquid . Hence the observed increase in volume of the liquid level is not actual increase in its volume . The expansion of the liquid relative to the container is called as Apparent Expansion . the actual expansion of the liquid is called Real ( or ) Absolute expansion . The ratio of apparent increase in volume of the liquid per unit rise of temperature to the original volume is called as coefficient of apparent expansion . For small and same rise in temperature the increase in volume ( real expansion ) of liquid is equal to the sum of apparent increase in volume ( apparent expansion ) of liquid and the increase in volume of the containing vessel . Thus a liquid has two coefficients of expansion . When measuring the expansion of a liquid , the measurement must account for the expansion of the container as well . For example , a flask that has been constructed with a long narrow stem filled with enough liquid that the stem itself is partially filled , when placed in a heat bath will initially show the column of liquid in the stem to drop followed by the immediate increase of that column until the flask - liquid - heat bath system has thermalized . The initial observation of the column of liquid dropping is not due to an initial contraction of the liquid but rather the expansion of the flask as it contacts the heat bath first . Soon after , the liquid in the flask is heated by the flask itself and begins to expand . Since liquids typically have a greater expansion over solids , the liquid in the flask eventually exceeds that of the flask , causing the column of liquid in the flask to rise . A direct measurement of the height of the liquid column is a measurement of the apparent expansion of the liquid . The absolute expansion of the liquid is the apparent expansion corrected for the expansion of the containing vessel . Examples and applications ( edit ) For applications using the thermal expansion property , see bimetallic strip and mercury - in - glass thermometer . Thermal expansion of long continuous sections of rail tracks is the driving force for rail buckling . This phenomenon resulted in 190 train derailments during 1998 -- 2002 in the US alone . The expansion and contraction of materials must be considered when designing large structures , when using tape or chain to measure distances for land surveys , when designing molds for casting hot material , and in other engineering applications when large changes in dimension due to temperature are expected . Thermal expansion is also used in mechanical applications to fit parts over one another , e.g. a bushing can be fitted over a shaft by making its inner diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the shaft , then heating it until it fits over the shaft , and allowing it to cool after it has been pushed over the shaft , thus achieving a ' shrink fit ' . Induction shrink fitting is a common industrial method to pre-heat metal components between 150 \u00b0 C and 300 \u00b0 C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component . There exist some alloys with a very small linear expansion coefficient , used in applications that demand very small changes in physical dimension over a range of temperatures . One of these is Invar 36 , with \u03b1 approximately equal to 0.6 \u00d7 10 K. These alloys are useful in aerospace applications where wide temperature swings may occur . Pullinger 's apparatus is used to determine the linear expansion of a metallic rod in the laboratory . The apparatus consists of a metal cylinder closed at both ends ( called a steam jacket ) . It is provided with an inlet and outlet for the steam . The steam for heating the rod is supplied by a boiler which is connected by a rubber tube to the inlet . The center of the cylinder contains a hole to insert a thermometer . The rod under investigation is enclosed in a steam jacket . One of its ends is free , but the other end is pressed against a fixed screw . The position of the rod is determined by a micrometer screw gauge or spherometer . Drinking glass with fracture due to uneven thermal expansion after pouring of hot liquid into the otherwise cool glass The control of thermal expansion in brittle materials is a key concern for a wide range of reasons . For example , both glass and ceramics are brittle and uneven temperature causes uneven expansion which again causes thermal stress and this might lead to fracture . Ceramics need to be joined or work in concert with a wide range of materials and therefore their expansion must be matched to the application . Because glazes need to be firmly attached to the underlying porcelain ( or other body type ) their thermal expansion must be tuned to ' fit ' the body so that crazing or shivering do not occur . Good example of products whose thermal expansion is the key to their success are CorningWare and the spark plug . The thermal expansion of ceramic bodies can be controlled by firing to create crystalline species that will influence the overall expansion of the material in the desired direction . In addition or instead the formulation of the body can employ materials delivering particles of the desired expansion to the matrix . The thermal expansion of glazes is controlled by their chemical composition and the firing schedule to which they were subjected . In most cases there are complex issues involved in controlling body and glaze expansion , adjusting for thermal expansion must be done with an eye to other properties that will be affected , generally trade - offs are required . Thermal expansion can have a noticeable effect in gasoline stored in above ground storage tanks which can cause gasoline pumps to dispense gasoline which may be more compressed than gasoline held in underground storage tanks in the winter time or less compressed than gasoline held in underground storage tanks in the summer time . Expansion loop on heating pipeline Heat - induced expansion has to be taken into account in most areas of engineering . A few examples are : Metal framed windows need rubber spacers Rubber tires Metal hot water heating pipes should not be used in long straight lengths Large structures such as railways and bridges need expansion joints in the structures to avoid sun kink One of the reasons for the poor performance of cold car engines is that parts have inefficiently large spacings until the normal operating temperature is achieved . A gridiron pendulum uses an arrangement of different metals to maintain a more temperature stable pendulum length . A power line on a hot day is droopy , but on a cold day it is tight . This is because the metals expand under heat . Expansion joints that absorb the thermal expansion in a piping system . Precision engineering nearly always requires the engineer to pay attention to the thermal expansion of the product . For example , when using a scanning electron microscope small changes in temperature such as 1 degree can cause a sample to change its position relative to the focus point . Thermometers are another application of thermal expansion -- most contain a liquid ( usually mercury or alcohol ) which is constrained to flow in only one direction ( along the tube ) due to changes in volume brought about by changes in temperature . A bi-metal mechanical thermometer uses a bimetallic strip and bends due to the differing thermal expansion of the two metals . Metal pipes made of different materials are heated by passing steam through them . While each pipe is being tested , one end is securely fixed and the other rests on a rotating shaft , the motion of which is indicated with a pointer . The linear expansion of the different metals is compared qualitatively and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion is calculated . Thermal expansion coefficients for various materials ( edit ) Main article : Thermal expansion coefficients of the elements ( data page ) Volumetric thermal expansion coefficient for a semicrystalline polypropylene . Linear thermal expansion coefficient for some steel grades . This section summarizes the coefficients for some common materials . For isotropic materials the coefficients linear thermal expansion \u03b1 and volumetric thermal expansion \u03b1 are related by \u03b1 = 3\u03b1 . For liquids usually the coefficient of volumetric expansion is listed and linear expansion is calculated here for comparison . For common materials like many metals and compounds , the thermal expansion coefficient is inversely proportional to the melting point . In particular for metals the relation is : \u03b1 \u2248 0.020 M P ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha \\ approx ( \\ frac ( 0.020 ) ( M_ ( P ) ) ) ) for halides and oxides \u03b1 \u2248 0.038 M P \u2212 7.0 \u22c5 10 \u2212 6 K \u2212 1 ( \\ displaystyle \\ alpha \\ approx ( \\ frac ( 0.038 ) ( M_ ( P ) ) ) - 7.0 \\ cdot 10 ^ ( - 6 ) \\ , \\ mathrm ( K ) ^ ( - 1 ) ) In the table below , the range for \u03b1 is from 10 K for hard solids to 10 K for organic liquids . The coefficient \u03b1 varies with the temperature and some materials have a very high variation ; see for example the variation vs. temperature of the volumetric coefficient for a semicrystalline polypropylene ( PP ) at different pressure , and the variation of the linear coefficient vs. temperature for some steel grades ( from bottom to top : ferritic stainless steel , martensitic stainless steel , carbon steel , duplex stainless steel , austenitic steel ) . The highest linear coefficient in a solid has been reported for a Ti - Nb alloy . ( The formula \u03b1 \u2248 3\u03b1 is usually used for solids . ) Material Linear coefficient \u03b1 at 20 \u00b0 C ( 10 K ) Volumetric coefficient \u03b1 at 20 \u00b0 C ( 10 K ) Notes Aluminium 23.1 69 Aluminium nitride 4.2 a-axis , 5.3 c - axis 13.7 AlN is anisotropic Benzocyclobutene 42 126 Brass 19 57 Carbon steel 10.8 32.4 CFRP -- 0.8 Anisotropic Fiber direction Concrete 12 36 Copper 17 51 Diamond Ethanol 250 750 Gallium ( III ) arsenide 5.8 17.4 Gasoline 317 950 Glass 8.5 25.5 Glass , borosilicate 3.3 9.9 matched sealing partner for tungsten , molybdenum and kovar .

{"document_plaintext":"Mass number - wikipedia Mass number The mass number ( symbol A , from the German word Atomgewichte ( atomic weight ) , also called atomic mass number or nucleon number , is the total number of protons and neutrons ( together known as nucleons ) in an atomic nucleus . It determines the atomic mass of atoms . Because protons and neutrons both are baryons , the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion . The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element . This is not the same as the atomic number ( Z ) which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus , and thus uniquely identifies an element . Hence , the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( N ) in a given nucleus : N = A \u2212 Z ( \\ displaystyle N = A-Z ) . The mass number is written either after the element name or as a superscript to the left of an element 's symbol . For example , the most common isotope of carbon is carbon - 12 , or , which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons . The full isotope symbol would also have the atomic number ( Z ) as a subscript to the left of the element symbol directly below the mass number : C . This is technically redundant , as each element is defined by its atomic number , so it is often omitted . Mass number changes in radioactive decay ( edit ) Different types of radioactive decay are characterized by their changes in mass number as well as atomic number , according to the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy . For example , uranium - 238 usually decays by alpha decay , where the nucleus loses two neutrons and two protons in the form of an alpha particle . Thus the atomic number and the number of neutrons each decrease by 2 ( Z : 92 \u2192 90 , N : 146 \u2192 144 ) , so that the mass number decreases by 4 ( A = 238 \u2192 234 ) ; the result is an atom of thorium - 234 and an alpha particle ( He ) : U \u2192 Th + He On the other hand , carbon - 14 naturally decays by radioactive beta decay , whereby one neutron is transmuted into a proton with the emission of an electron and an anti-neutrino . Thus the atomic number increases by 1 ( Z : 6 \u2192 7 ) and the mass number remains the same ( A = 14 ) , while the number of neutrons decreases by 1 ( N : 8 \u2192 7 ) . The resulting atom is nitrogen - 14 , with seven protons and seven neutrons : C \u2192 + + \u03bd Another type of radioactive decay without change in mass number is emission of a gamma ray from a nuclear isomer or metastable excited state of an atomic nucleus . Since all the protons and neutrons remain in the nucleus unchanged in this process , the mass number is also unchanged . Mass number and isotopic mass ( edit ) The mass number gives an estimate of the isotopic mass measured in atomic mass units ( u ) . For C the isotopic mass is exactly 12 , since the atomic mass unit is defined as 1 \/ 12 of the mass of C. For other isotopes , the isotopic mass is usually within 0.1 u of the mass number . For example , Cl ( 17 protons and 18 neutrons ) has a mass number of 35 and an isotopic mass of 34.96885 . The difference between mass number of an atom and its isotopic mass is known as the mass excess . Mass excess should not be confused with mass defect which is the difference between the mass of an atom and its constituent particles ( namely protons , neutrons and electrons ) . There are two reasons for mass defect \/ excess : The neutron is slightly heavier than the proton . This increases the mass of nuclei with more neutrons than protons relative to the atomic mass unit scale based on C with equal numbers of protons and neutrons . The nuclear binding energy varies between nuclei . A nucleus with greater binding energy has a lower total energy , and therefore a lower mass according to Einstein 's mass - energy equivalence relation E = mc . For Cl the isotopic mass is less than 35 so this must be the dominant factor . Relative atomic mass of an element ( edit ) The mass number should also not be confused with the standard atomic weight ( also called atomic weight ) of an element , which is the ratio of the average atomic mass of the different isotopes of that element ( weighted by abundance ) to the unified atomic mass unit . The atomic weight is an actual mass ( made relative , i.e. , a ratio ) , while the mass number is a counted number ( and so an integer ) . This weighted average can be quite different from the near - integer values for individual isotopic masses . For instance , there are two main isotopes of chlorine : chlorine - 35 and chlorine - 37 . In any given sample of chlorine that has not been subjected to mass separation there will be roughly 75 % of chlorine atoms which are chlorine - 35 and only 25 % of chlorine atoms which are chlorine - 37 . This gives chlorine a relative atomic mass of 35.5 ( actually 35.4527 g \/ mol ) . Moreover , the weighted average mass can be near - integer , but at the same time not corresponding to the mass of any natural isotope . For example , bromine has only two stable isotopes , Br and Br , naturally present in approximately equal fractions , which leads to the standard atomic mass of bromine close to 80 ( 79.904 g \/ mol ) , even though the isotope Br with such mass is unstable .
