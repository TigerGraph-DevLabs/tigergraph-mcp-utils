## Installation Steps


### **Option 1: Install from PyPI**

The simplest way to get started with **TigerGraphX** is by installing it directly from PyPI. Using a virtual environment is recommended to ensure a clean and isolated setup.

To install TigerGraphX, run:
```bash
pip install tigergraphx
```

This allows you to quickly start using the library without needing the source code.

#### **Verify Installation**

After installing, verify that TigerGraphX is installed correctly by running:
```bash
python -c "import tigergraphx; print('TigerGraphX installed successfully!')"
```

If the installation was successful, you will see:
```
TigerGraphX installed successfully!
```

This ensures that the library is properly installed and ready for use.

### **Option 2: Build from Source Code**

If you want to modify or explore the source code, you can install TigerGraphX from its GitHub repository. The source code is available here: [TigerGraphX on GitHub](https://github.com/xuanleilin/tigergraphx).

This project uses **Poetry** to manage dependencies. If you don’t have Poetry installed, follow the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Once Poetry is installed, clone the repository, navigate to the project’s root directory, and use one of the following commands to install dependencies based on your needs:

#### **Core Installation**
If you need only the core functionality of TigerGraphX (without running application examples like GraphRAG, unit tests, or integration tests), run:
```bash
poetry install --without dev
```

This command will:

- Install only the dependencies required for the core features of TigerGraphX.

#### **Development Installation**
If you’re contributing to the project or want to use advanced features like running the GraphRAG examples or test cases, run:
```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

This command will:

- Install all core dependencies.
- Include development dependencies defined under `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`.

#### **Verify Your Installation**
After installing dependencies, verify your setup by listing the installed packages:
```bash
poetry show --with dev
```

This ensures all required dependencies (including optional ones) are successfully installed.
