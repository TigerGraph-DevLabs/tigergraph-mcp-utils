## Installing Dependencies

This project uses **Poetry** to manage dependencies. If you donâ€™t already have Poetry installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Once Poetry is installed, navigate to the root directory of the project and run one of the following commands depending on your needs:

### **Option 1: Install Only TigerGraphX Core**
If you only want to use TigerGraphX without unit/integration tests and applications like GraphRAG, run:
```bash
poetry install --without dev
```

This command will:
- Read the `pyproject.toml` file.
- Install only the required dependencies needed for TigerGraphX.

---

### **Option 2: Install with Development Dependencies**
If you want to include development features such as unit/integration tests and applications like GraphRAG, run:
```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

This command will:
- Install all core dependencies.
- Include development dependencies specified in the `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]` section of `pyproject.toml`.

---

## Verifying the Installation

Once the dependencies are installed, you can verify your setup by running the following command:
```bash
poetry show --with dev
```

This will list all the installed dependencies in your environment.
