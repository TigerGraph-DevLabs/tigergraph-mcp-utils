    "[LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) is an open-source RAG system that enhances LLMs by integrating graph-based structures into text indexing and retrieval. It overcomes the limitations of traditional RAG systems, such as fragmented answers and weak contextual awareness, by enabling dual-level retrieval for more comprehensive knowledge discovery. With support for incremental data updates, LightRAG ensures timely integration of new information while delivering improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "This code defines the `TigerGraphStorage` class, which interacts with **TigerGraphX** to manage graph data in TigerGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Schema**  \n",
    "   - Defines a node type `\"Entity\"` with attributes like `id`, `entity_type`, `description`, and `source_id`.\n",
    "   - Defines an edge type `\"relationship\"` with attributes like `weight`, `description`, and `source_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Initialization**  \n",
    "   - Initializes the graph with the schema using **TigerGraphX**.\n",
    "   - Connection details (host, ports, authentication) are fetched from environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Node and Edge Operations**  \n",
    "   - **Node Operations**:\n",
    "     - `has_node`: Checks if a node exists.\n",
    "     - `get_node`: Gets data for a node.\n",
    "     - `upsert_node`: Adds or updates a node.\n",
    "     - `delete_node`: Deletes a node.\n",
    "   - **Edge Operations**:\n",
    "     - `has_edge`: Checks if an edge exists.\n",
    "     - `get_edge`: Gets data for an edge.\n",
    "     - `upsert_edge`: Adds or updates an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Graph Metrics**  \n",
    "   - `node_degree`: Returns the number of connections a node has.\n",
    "   - `edge_degree`: Calculates the combined degrees of two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Additional Functions**  \n",
    "   - **`clean_quotes`**: Strips quotes from strings.\n",
    "   - **`drop_graph`**: Deletes the entire graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "The `TigerGraphStorage` class helps manage and interact with graph data in TigerGraph by offering simple methods for storing, retrieving, and managing nodes, edges, and graph metrics."

    "This code defines the `TigerVectorStorage` class, which is used for storing and querying vector data (like embeddings) in a TigerGraph database using **TigerGraphX**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Schema**  \n",
    "   - The graph schema defines a node type called `\"Table\"`, which has attributes including an `id` and a vector attribute for storing embeddings. The vector attribute's dimension is based on the `embedding_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Upsert Method**  \n",
    "   - The `upsert` method inserts or updates vector data in the TigerGraph database. It batches the data and generates embeddings asynchronously using `embedding_func`, then stores these embeddings in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Method**  \n",
    "   - The `query` method performs a vector search in the TigerGraph database to find the most similar nodes based on a query vector. It uses the `embedding_func` to generate the query vector and then queries the database for the closest nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "`TigerVectorStorage` enables the use of vector embeddings in TigerGraph, allowing for efficient storage and search of vector data."

      "**Themes in \"A Christmas Carol\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A Christmas Carol\" by Charles Dickens is a rich narrative that explores several powerful themes, ultimately leading to a story about redemption and human connection. Below are the top themes that weave throughout the tale:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Redemption and Transformation**\n",
      "One of the most prominent themes in \"A Christmas Carol\" is the possibility of redemption. Ebenezer Scrooge, the storyâ€™s central character, undergoes a profound transformation from a cold-hearted miser to a generous and caring individual. This journey is ignited by the visits from three spiritsâ€”Marley's Ghost, the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Comeâ€”who guide him to reflect on his life choices and their ramifications. The notion that anyone can change, regardless of their past actions, stands as an optimistic commentary on the human experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **The Spirit of Christmas**\n",
      "Christmas serves as a backdrop for themes of joy, generosity, and community. Initially, Scrooge dismisses Christmas as nonsense and a burden; however, through various encounters, he learns the true essence of the holiday: caring for others, celebrating family, and spreading goodwill. The contrast between Scroogeâ€™s grim perspective and the joyous spirit of Christmas embodied by characters like his nephew Fred and the Cratchit family illustrates the importance of community and connection during the festive season.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Social Critique and Wealth**\n",
      "Dickens employs Scroogeâ€™s character to critique social issues such as greed, poverty, and the divide between the wealthy and the impoverished. Scrooge's initial indifference towards the needy reflects systemic societal neglect. Through his transformation, Dickens advocates for social responsibility and the need for individuals to act compassionately towards the less fortunate, symbolized in characters like Tiny Tim, whose fragility highlights the impact of societal indifference on vulnerable lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Familial Bonds and Love**\n",
      "The narrative emphasizes the significance of family relationships and the warmth of loving connections. Scroogeâ€™s reflections on his past, particularly his memories of family gatherings, convey a longing for connection and belonging, which he initially shuns. The Cratchit family, despite their financial struggles, exemplifies love and togetherness, contrasting Scroogeâ€™s isolation. By the story's end, Scrooge learns to appreciate and actively engage with his family, indicating a renewal of these essential bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Time and Memory**\n",
      "The theme of time is central to Scrooge's transformation, as he confronts moments from his past, experiences the joys and struggles of the present, and considers the potential bleak future his choices could lead to. Dickens underscores the importance of memory in shaping one's identity and moral fabric. Scrooge's retrospective journey highlights the necessity of reflecting on past actions to foster personal growth and responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In \"A Christmas Carol,\" Dickens masterfully intertwines themes of redemption, compassion, and social awareness, creating a narrative that resonates with the importance of kindness and community spirit. Through Scroogeâ€™s transformation, readers are reminded of the power of empathy, the significance of familial connections, and the universal potential for redemption. Ultimately, the story serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring values associated with the holiday season.\n"
