    "[LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) is an open-source RAG system that enhances LLMs by integrating graph-based structures into text indexing and retrieval. It overcomes the limitations of traditional RAG systems, such as fragmented answers and weak contextual awareness, by enabling dual-level retrieval for more comprehensive knowledge discovery. With support for incremental data updates, LightRAG ensures timely integration of new information while delivering improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "This code defines a `TigerGraphStorage` class that implements the `BaseGraphStorage` interface for graph storage and retrieval using **TigerGraphX**, a Python library for interacting with TigerGraph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key highlights of this implementation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Initialization**  \n",
    "   - An **undirected homogeneous graph** (`UndiGraph`) is initialized. This graph type supports only one type of node and edge, making it similar to **NetworkX**'s undirected graph.\n",
    "   - TigerGraph’s schema-based nature requires a graph schema definition with specific attributes for nodes and edges. For instance:  \n",
    "     - Node attributes: `id`, `entity_type`, `description`, `source_id`  \n",
    "     - Edge attributes: `weight`, `description`, `keywords`, `source_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TigerGraphX Interfaces**  \n",
    "   - TigerGraphX provides user-friendly interfaces, very similar to NetworkX, which simplify operations like:  \n",
    "     - **Node Operations**: `has_node`, `add_node`, `remove_node`, `get_node_data`  \n",
    "     - **Edge Operations**: `has_edge`, `add_edge`, `get_edge_data`, `get_node_edges`  \n",
    "     - **Degree Calculation**: `degree` for nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Methods**  \n",
    "   - **Storage Operations**:  \n",
    "     - `upsert_node`: Inserts or updates a node with its data.  \n",
    "     - `upsert_edge`: Inserts or updates an edge between two nodes.  \n",
    "     - `delete_node`: Deletes a node if it exists.  \n",
    "   - **Data Retrieval**:  \n",
    "     - `get_node`: Retrieves data for a specific node.  \n",
    "     - `get_edge`: Retrieves data for a specific edge.  \n",
    "     - `get_node_edges`: Retrieves all edges for a given node.  \n",
    "   - **Graph Metrics**:  \n",
    "     - `node_degree`: Returns the degree of a node.  \n",
    "     - `edge_degree`: Calculates combined degrees of two nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Additional Notes**  \n",
    "   - The `clean_quotes` method ensures clean input values by stripping leading and trailing quotes from strings.  \n",
    "   - TigerGraphX goes beyond NetworkX’s capabilities by supporting **heterogeneous graphs** (graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges) using the `Graph` class, in addition to undirected (`UndiGraph`) and directed graphs (`DiGraph`)."

      "\n",
      "The overall financial health of CytoSorbents Corporation can be assessed through its funding strategies, revenue generation, and partnerships contributing to its growth in medical technology specifically focusing on blood purification products, with a particular emphasis on the CytoSorb device.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Funding Sources and Capital Raising\n",
      "\n",
      "CytoSorbents has successfully raised approximately **$214 million** from investors through various funding mechanisms including public offerings, convertible note offerings, and equity transactions. A significant public offering occurred on **July 24, 2020**, where the company sold **6,052,631 shares at a price of $9.50 per share**, raising gross proceeds of about **$57.5 million**. After expenses, this resulted in net proceeds of **$53.8 million**. Additionally, a new sale agreement allows CytoSorbents to sell its common stock at market prices through financial agents, increasing flexibility in capital management. This indicates a robust ability to attract investment for development and research.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Revenue from Sales and Market Expansion\n",
      "\n",
      "CytoSorbents has generated revenue through the sales of its CytoSorb device, especially in significant markets like **Germany**, where it has established its presence and received important reimbursement codes aiding its integration into healthcare systems. The company has also initiated distribution partnerships, for example, with **Biocon Biologics Limited** for exclusive rights to market CytoSorb in India, and **Fresenius** for broader international reach. These partnerships are pivotal in enhancing sales potential and penetrating emerging markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Clinical Trials and Regulation\n",
      "\n",
      "CytoSorbents is actively engaged in multiple clinical trials aimed at validating its product in various applications, including ongoing studies addressing conditions like **sepsis** and **COVID-19**. The company received **Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)** from the FDA for CytoSorb during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting its responsiveness to market needs and ability to pivot in critical times. The successful conclusion of these trials is expected to bolster revenue further by allowing broader application and market access for CytoSorb.\n",
