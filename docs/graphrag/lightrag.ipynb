    "[LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) is an open-source RAG system that enhances LLMs by integrating graph-based structures into text indexing and retrieval. It overcomes the limitations of traditional RAG systems, such as fragmented answers and weak contextual awareness, by enabling dual-level retrieval for more comprehensive knowledge discovery. With support for incremental data updates, LightRAG ensures timely integration of new information while delivering improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "This code defines a `TigerGraphStorage` class that implements the `BaseGraphStorage` interface for graph storage and retrieval using **TigerGraphX**, a Python library for interacting with TigerGraph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key highlights of this implementation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Initialization**  \n",
    "   - An **undirected homogeneous graph** (`UndiGraph`) is initialized. This graph type supports only one type of node and edge, making it similar to **NetworkX**'s undirected graph.\n",
    "   - TigerGraph’s schema-based nature requires a graph schema definition with specific attributes for nodes and edges. For instance:  \n",
    "     - Node attributes: `id`, `entity_type`, `description`, `source_id`  \n",
    "     - Edge attributes: `weight`, `description`, `keywords`, `source_id`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **TigerGraphX Interfaces**  \n",
    "   - TigerGraphX provides user-friendly interfaces, very similar to NetworkX, which simplify operations like:  \n",
    "     - **Node Operations**: `has_node`, `add_node`, `remove_node`, `get_node_data`  \n",
    "     - **Edge Operations**: `has_edge`, `add_edge`, `get_edge_data`, `get_node_edges`  \n",
    "     - **Degree Calculation**: `degree` for nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Methods**  \n",
    "   - **Storage Operations**:  \n",
    "     - `upsert_node`: Inserts or updates a node with its data.  \n",
    "     - `upsert_edge`: Inserts or updates an edge between two nodes.  \n",
    "     - `delete_node`: Deletes a node if it exists.  \n",
    "   - **Data Retrieval**:  \n",
    "     - `get_node`: Retrieves data for a specific node.  \n",
    "     - `get_edge`: Retrieves data for a specific edge.  \n",
    "     - `get_node_edges`: Retrieves all edges for a given node.  \n",
    "   - **Graph Metrics**:  \n",
    "     - `node_degree`: Returns the degree of a node.  \n",
    "     - `edge_degree`: Calculates combined degrees of two nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Additional Notes**  \n",
    "   - The `clean_quotes` method ensures clean input values by stripping leading and trailing quotes from strings.  \n",
    "   - TigerGraphX goes beyond NetworkX’s capabilities by supporting **heterogeneous graphs** (graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges) using the `Graph` class, in addition to undirected (`UndiGraph`) and directed graphs (`DiGraph`)."

      "\n",
      "### Revenue Generation\n",
      "\n",
      "CytoSorbents Corporation primarily generates revenue through the sales of its flagship product, CytoSorb. Since its launch in Germany in 2012, the company has achieved cumulative sales of approximately $111.8 million by the end of 2020. A significant portion of the company's revenue is sourced from direct product sales in Germany, where reimbursement has been established for CytoSorb, aiding its adoption in critical care settings. Additionally, the company has expanded its reach to other European countries and regions, establishing commercial partnerships to enhance market penetration.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Funding and Financial Support\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has actively sought funding to support its research and development efforts, securing grants and contracts amounting to approximately $28.4 million from notable sources including DARPA, the U.S. Army, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This financial backing underscores the company’s ability to leverage government funding for growth and innovation in medical technology. Moreover, the company has utilized convertible notes, equity transactions, and term loans as financing mechanisms, further diversifying its funding sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Equity Transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "CytoSorbents Corporation has engaged in public offerings to raise capital. On July 24, 2020, the company closed an underwritten public offering that raised approximately $53.8 million in net proceeds. This indicates robust market interest and the company’s ability to access capital markets effectively, which is vital for ongoing development and commercialization efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Partnerships and Strategic Collaborations\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaboration with partners such as B. Braun Avitum AG, Biocon Biologics Limited, and Fresenius Medical Care has enabled CytoSorbents to expand its distribution network and enhance the visibility of its products across different markets. These partnerships not only facilitate market entry but also strengthen the overall financial standing by broadening the revenue base.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the financial health of CytoSorbents Corporation appears solid, characterized by consistent revenue streams from its primary product, strategic use of funding to support ongoing research and development, and successful capital raising activities. Collaborations with reputable partners add a layer of financial stability and potential for future growth. However, like any company in the biotech sector, the financial outlook will be subject to the usual risks associated with regulatory approvals, market acceptance, and competition within the healthcare industry.\n"
