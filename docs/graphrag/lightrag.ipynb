    "[LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) is an open-source RAG system that enhances LLMs by integrating graph-based structures into text indexing and retrieval. It overcomes the limitations of traditional RAG systems, such as fragmented answers and weak contextual awareness, by enabling dual-level retrieval for more comprehensive knowledge discovery. With support for incremental data updates, LightRAG ensures timely integration of new information while delivering improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency.\n",

    "This code defines the `TigerGraphStorage` class, which interacts with **TigerGraphX** to manage graph data in TigerGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Schema**  \n",
    "   - Defines a node type `\"Entity\"` with attributes like `id`, `entity_type`, `description`, and `source_id`.\n",
    "   - Defines an edge type `\"relationship\"` with attributes like `weight`, `description`, and `source_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Initialization**  \n",
    "   - Initializes the graph with the schema using **TigerGraphX**.\n",
    "   - Connection details (host, ports, authentication) are fetched from environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Node and Edge Operations**  \n",
    "   - **Node Operations**:\n",
    "     - `has_node`: Checks if a node exists.\n",
    "     - `get_node`: Gets data for a node.\n",
    "     - `upsert_node`: Adds or updates a node.\n",
    "     - `delete_node`: Deletes a node.\n",
    "   - **Edge Operations**:\n",
    "     - `has_edge`: Checks if an edge exists.\n",
    "     - `get_edge`: Gets data for an edge.\n",
    "     - `upsert_edge`: Adds or updates an edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Graph Metrics**  \n",
    "   - `node_degree`: Returns the number of connections a node has.\n",
    "   - `edge_degree`: Calculates the combined degrees of two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Additional Functions**  \n",
    "   - **`clean_quotes`**: Strips quotes from strings.\n",
    "   - **`drop_graph`**: Deletes the entire graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "The `TigerGraphStorage` class helps manage and interact with graph data in TigerGraph by offering simple methods for storing, retrieving, and managing nodes, edges, and graph metrics."

    "This code defines the `TigerVectorStorage` class, which is used for storing and querying vector data (like embeddings) in a TigerGraph database using **TigerGraphX**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Schema**  \n",
    "   - The graph schema defines a node type called `\"Table\"`, which has attributes including an `id` and a vector attribute for storing embeddings. The vector attribute's dimension is based on the `embedding_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Upsert Method**  \n",
    "   - The `upsert` method inserts or updates vector data in the TigerGraph database. It batches the data and generates embeddings asynchronously using `embedding_func`, then stores these embeddings in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Method**  \n",
    "   - The `query` method performs a vector search in the TigerGraph database to find the most similar nodes based on a query vector. It uses the `embedding_func` to generate the query vector and then queries the database for the closest nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "`TigerVectorStorage` enables the use of vector embeddings in TigerGraph, allowing for efficient storage and search of vector data."

      "------------------- Query Result:  -------------------\n",
      "In Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" several prominent themes intertwine within the narrative, reflecting the transformative journey of the central character, Ebenezer Scrooge. These themes serve as moral lessons that resonate deeply with readers and highlight the societal issues of Dickens' time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Redemption and Transformation\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme of redemption stands out as one of the most significant aspects of Scrooge's character arc. Initially portrayed as a miserly and cold-hearted individual, Scroogeâ€™s encounters with various spiritsâ€”most notably the Spirit of Christmas Past, the Spirit of Christmas Present, and the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Comeâ€”underscore his potential for change. Through these supernatural visitations, Scrooge comes to realize the consequences of his actions and attitudes toward others, particularly his neglect of the less fortunate. This realization serves as a catalyst for his transformation from a figure of disdain to one of generosity and kindness, ultimately embodying the spirit of Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Spirit of Christmas\n",
      "\n",
      "Another essential theme revolves around the essence of Christmas itself, characterized by joy, goodwill, and communal spirit. Christmas is portrayed as a time of reflection, compassion, and generosity, contrasting sharply with Scroogeâ€™s initial cynicism. Dickens emphasizes that the holiday season is an opportunity for individuals to reconnect with their humanity, fostering relationships and nurturing feelings of empathy. Instances within the story, such as the Cratchit family's humble Christmas dinner, reveal how love and celebration can thrive even amidst hardship, highlighting the importance of community and kind-heartedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compassion and Social Responsibility\n",
      "\n",
      "Compassion emerges as a vital theme, urging recognition of the struggles faced by the less fortunate. Scroogeâ€™s initial apathy towards the needy epitomizes societal indifference, reflected in his dismissive responses to the pleas for charitable contributions. In stark contrast, the Cratchit family, particularly through the character of Tiny Tim, embodies the spirit of resilience and hope despite their economic hardships. Dickens employs Tiny Tim's situation to showcase the impact of poverty, advocating for social responsibility and awareness of those less fortunate. Scrooge's eventual embracing of compassion signifies a shift from self-interest to a broader understanding that oneâ€™s moral obligations extend to the community at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Consequences of Isolation\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrative also explores the repercussions of isolation and disconnection. Scrooge, who initially chooses solitude over companionship, experiences profound loneliness, which blinds him to the joys of life and the importance of human connections. His relationships with characters such as his nephew Fred, who embodies the spirit of family and celebration, illustrate the positive impact of social ties. The evolution of Scrooge's character highlights the essential human need for connection, revealing that true wealth lies not in material possessions but in shared experiences and relationships.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Time and Reflection\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the theme of time plays a critical role in Scrooge's transformation. His encounters with the spirits allow him to reflect on his past choices, current realities, and potential futures. The narrative demonstrates how reflecting on one's life can prompt significant personal growth and ultimately shape one's destiny. This exploration of time serves as a reminder that it is never too late to change one's path, advocating for mindfulness in one's actions and their implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, \"A Christmas Carol\" is rich with themes of redemption, the spirit of Christmas, compassion, the effects of isolation, and the significance of time. Together, these themes contribute to a timeless narrative that not only entertains but also imparts profound moral lessons about the nature of humanity and the transformative power of kindness and generosity. Through Scroogeâ€™s journey, Dickens encourages readers to embrace the festive spirit and recognize their roles as members of a compassionate community.\n"
