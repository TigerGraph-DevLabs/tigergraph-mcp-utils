## GraphRAG Workflow with TigerGraph

### **1. Schema Design**

Define the graph schema with nodes, edges, and attributes tailored to your application, leveraging TigerGraph’s native support for structured graph data.

### **2. Data Preparation and Loading**

Transform raw data into TigerGraph-compatible formats, including graph structures and embeddings, and load it efficiently into TigerGraph using TigerGraphX.

### **3. Knowledge Graph Management and Analysis**
Maintain and enhance the knowledge graph to ensure data quality, relevance, and scalability. Perform in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, infer insights, and optimize data retrieval strategies; ensure the knowledge graph remains a dynamic, accurate, and actionable source of information, enriching context for LLMs while supporting explainability and scalability in the GraphRAG workflow.

### **4. Hybrid Retrieval**

Combine structured queries, semantic search, and vector-based methods to fetch relevant data and embeddings from TigerGraph for context construction.

### **5. Context Building**

Use TigerGraphX to process retrieved data, making it token-aware and formatted to meet the requirements of LLMs.

### **6. LLM Integration**

Pass the context to an LLM to generate responses, enabling advanced GraphRAG workflows with seamless data flow and high efficiency.
