## GraphRAG Workflow with TigerGraph

### **1. Schema Design**

Define the graph schema with nodes, edges, and attributes tailored to your application, leveraging TigerGraph’s native support for structured graph data.

### **2. Data Preparation and Loading**

Transform raw data into TigerGraph-compatible formats, including graph structures and embeddings, and load it efficiently into TigerGraph using TigerGraphX.

### **3. Knowledge Graph Management and Analysis**
Maintain and enhance the knowledge graph to ensure data quality, relevance, and scalability. Perform in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, infer insights, and optimize data retrieval strategies; ensure the knowledge graph remains a dynamic, accurate, and actionable source of information, enriching context for LLMs while supporting explainability and scalability in the GraphRAG workflow.

### **4. Hybrid Retrieval**

Combine structured queries, semantic search, and vector-based methods to fetch relevant data and embeddings from TigerGraph for context construction.

### **5. Context Building**

Use TigerGraphX to process retrieved data, making it token-aware and formatted to meet the requirements of LLMs.

### **6. LLM Integration**

Pass the context to an LLM to generate responses, enabling advanced GraphRAG workflows with seamless data flow and high efficiency.

## Two Options for Implementing GraphRAG with TigerGraph

There are two approaches to implementing GraphRAG with TigerGraph.

### **1. TigerGraph as a Storage and Retrieval Engine**
The first approach primarily utilizes TigerGraph for storing and retrieving graph/vector data. TigerGraphX provides interfaces similar to NetworkX, allowing seamless integration with GraphRAG applications. This approach is recommended for GraphRAG solutions like [LightRAG](https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG) and [Nano-GraphRAG](https://github.com/gusye1234/nano-graphrag), which abstract their storage layers (e.g., graph storage, key-value storage, and vector storage). Here, you only need to implement these layers in a way that aligns with TigerGraph.

### **2. TigerGraph for Storage and Retrieval; TigerGraphX for LLM Tasks**
The second approach extends beyond storage and retrieval by leveraging TigerGraphX for tasks related to large language models (LLMs), such as chat or embedding generation. This approach is suitable for complex projects like [Microsoft's GraphRAG](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag). As of December 2024, Microsoft's GraphRAG has not yet abstracted its storage layer, making it challenging to replace the indexing process. However, TigerGraphX can be used to convert the results of the indexing process (e.g., Parquet files) into a format supported by TigerGraph. These results can then be imported into TigerGraph, and TigerGraphX can handle the querying process without relying on Microsoft’s GraphRAG.

### **Demonstrations**
Both methods are demonstrated on the following pages, each with a real-world project:

- **LightRAG**: Refer to [LightRAG](../lightrag) for the first approach.
- **Microsoft's GraphRAG**: Refer to [Microsoft GraphRAG: Part 1](msft_graphrag_1.md) for the second approach.
